Stop by on your break!\" So far so good, and then the next sentence: \"A vendor rep is on-site to explain about downloading the app and setting up an account.\"\n\nConfused but curious, I waited for the crowds to dwindle, and then went downstairs to our newly-remodeled snack-room. Bright colors. New machines. Bigger selection. And as promised, a vendor rep was eager to explain everything to me.\n\nFirst, you can no longer get into the room with the vending machines just by opening the door; now you need to swipe your employee badge. Inside, you're on surveillance camera, but I'm unsure who's watching the video -- my employer, or the vending machine company. Once you've set up an account and transferred some funds from your bank account, you make purchases with the app on your smart phone.\n\nA few of my company's management types were in the room, admiring the selection of candies and cookies, sodas and sandwiches, as this guy gave me the pitch. With bigwigs beside me, I probably shouldn\u2019t have chuckled, but chuckle I did. \"Do these machines take \u2026 you know, money?,\" I asked.\n\n\"Actually, no,\" said the chipper vendor rep. \"Nothing in this room accepts coins or dollar bills; only swipes and thumbprints.\" From his proud tone of voice, I think I was supposed to be impressed.\n\n\"So lemme get this straight. If I want a sack of potato chips, and I only have money, I'm out of luck?\"\n\n\"No problem,\" he said cheerfully. \"If you've downloaded the app, you can purchase anything in the room with your thumbprint. And if you haven't yet downloaded the app, our machines will still accept debit or credit cards.\"\n\nOblivious to the look on my face, Mr Vendor Rep rambled on about how easy the app is, and how to connect your bank account to the app, and how to register your thumbprint for the quickest, most convenient purchases. \"So,\" he said with a smile, \"are you ready to download the app?\"\n\n\"Actually, no. I am not downloading an app to buy a candy bar,\" I said. And then I wandered out of the room and back to my desk, sort of shell-shocked.\n\nI have a debit card, because I generally trust the credit union to keep my finances confidential, so maybe I'll buy something in the new snack-room someday ... but not someday soon. And I'm **never** connecting my bank info to some app from some company I've never heard of, the no-name outfit that stocks Snickers and Slim Jims in the snack-room at work.\n\nSeems I'm the only person among our 260-odd employees who preferred the old snack-room, where machines traded quarters and dollar bills for candy and Coke. But that's just me, wacky old antikarma98. Everyone else at work has downloaded the app and registered their thumbprints.\n\nWe are so damn doomed."}, {"id": "977unf", "name": "I want to apologize for my brother, and my other brother.", "n_comments": 77, "text": "I've been largely estranged from my immediate family for a lot of years, but several of them are vacationing in the town where I live, so we're spending a few days together. Last night we dined at a well-known mostly-breakfast chain -- my brothers \"Dick\" and \"Donnie,\" along with their wives and our mother and me -- and I was flabbergasted at my brothers' behavior. \n\nMy brother \"Dick\" was too loud and very abrupt with the waitress, changed his mind several times about what he was ordering *while* he was ordering, and demanded very little ice in his soda -- three times. When his soda came it had far less ice than anyone else's, but still too much for my brother, and he spent a few minutes loudly complaining about \"too much ice, why do they always give me too much ice?,\" within earshot of the waitress and in a restaurant he'd never been to before. My sister-in-law and I tried to calm and quiet him, but Dick took a handful of ice from his drink and was going to plop it on the carpet. \n\nI should mention, we're not teenagers. Far from it. We're all in our 60s and our mother is almost 90. My brothers both have grandchildren. The rest of our party, along with a polite but perplexed busboy, convinced my brother to put his \"too much ice\" in a doggy-box instead of on the floor, and I said, \"You know, *this kind of crap* is why you haven't seen me in twenty years.\"\n\nAfter that, our table was mostly well-behaved albeit a little too loud, and we agreed to have just one ticket and settle up afterwards. I left ten bucks tip under the plate for my $15 meal, and it wasn't until we split the tab the next morning that my other brother -- not Dick, who'd complained about the ice, but Donnie, our more level-headed and reasonable brother -- made fun of me for tipping. And at that point I figured out that I was the only one who'd tipped.\n\nSo I want to apologize for my brother, and my other brother. Our table was too loud, one of us was out of line, and we tipped just $10 on a $75 ticket. My wife and I eat at this place fairly often, and I'll be embarrassed to go back, but the next time we have that waitress I'm tipping the total tab."}, {"id": "hg8f45", "name": "Breakfast at the Diner \u2014 #5", "n_comments": 44, "text": "[removed]"}, {"id": "by9c37", "name": "Best breakfast in the Madison area", "n_comments": 237, "text": "We've all seen posts here asking, \"What restaurant serves the best breakfast in Madison?\" Well, my intent is to answer that question more than to ask it, but you're invited to tell me exactly what I'm full of, besides hotcakes and an omelet.\n\nI *love* breakfast at a good diner. It's the ultimate treat of living in the first-world, right up there with freedom of speech and certain sexual kinks and the American flag. So I've tried most of Madison's diners, caf\u00e9s, and restaurants, and since I almost always order the same breakfast, it's easy to compare the food and service. Also, the more times the waiter or waitress calls me \"Honey\" or \"Sweetie,\" the bigger the tip.\n\nMy usual order is a Denver omelet (with cheese? yes, please) and hash browns with (usually) toast or (sometimes) an English muffin, *plus* a short stack of pancakes on the side. Also, coffee with refills, please. And yes, that's quite a large breakfast, but I have it only once or twice a week, and eat sanely at home, so my body lets me get away with it.\n\nTL/DR \u2014 It all comes down to either **The Curve** or **Pat O'Malley's Jet Room**.\n\nFirst off, let's consider the chains \u2014 it's breakfast and it's adequate, but the food and service, flavors and ambiance, seats and d\u00e9cor and everything else is exactly the same as the last time you had breakfast anywhere on earth under the brand name on the sign. Maybe that's a good thing, if you're new in town or want something reliable.\n\nAmong the chains, the **Original Pancake House** in Monona has good food, good service, and easy parking, but also has caked-on dust on the overhead fans, which suggests to me that they might be lackadaisical about cleanliness in the kitchen as well. Better, and recommended if you're choosing only between the chains, is the **Original Pancake House** on University Avenue in Madison, which seems cleaner and dependably brings out a good breakfast.\n\nAfter that, my second choice among the chains would be **Perkins** over **Denny's** or **The Egg & I**, with **IHOP** in last place. To tell the truth, I'd rather skip breakfast than eat at IHOP \u2014 we had scary-bad service and food on multiple occasions at both the eastside and westside IHOPs. But more to the point, in Madison you can do *much* better than the chains.\n\nNext, let's list some restaurants I've tried but sadly eliminated from the competition, and why:\n\n**Copper Top Restaurant** \u2014 Service is friendly, the waitress will call you \"Honey,\" and your breakfast is going to be good, occasionally excellent. Coffee refills are frequent and generous. It's definitely a good choice if you're in the neighborhood, but I'm rarely in that neighborhood and it's a long drive from home. I'd recommend the Copper Top, but there are better choices. Eliminated in the semi-finals.\n\n**Fair Oaks Diner** \u2014 With checkerboard tiles on the floor and old-style stools at the counter, this place *looks* like the perfect all-American diner, and I wish it was. But my wife and I had breakfast there twice and lunch once, and *all three times* they lost our order in the kitchen. All three times, we waited forty-five minutes while folks who came in and ordered after us finished their meals and left. All three times we were polite in our inquiries, but we never heard an apology beyond \"I'll check to see what the problem might be.\" Third time's the anti-charm; never again.\n\n**Lazy Jane's Caf\u00e9 & Bakery** \u2014 Top notch food and service, at reasonable prices. My wife and I happily ate there at least twice a month, for years. So what's not to love? Folk music \u2014 two of the last three times we went, there was a guy with a guitar providing live music, accompanied by an amplifier turned up to eleven. We politely asked the manager if they could reduce the volume, and she just as politely declined. We took our plates to a far-distant table, but the music was inescapable. After the second time, we simply stopped visiting Lazy Jane's, but we never stopped jokingly reciting the lyrics to \"Freight Train,\" the folk song that nudged us out the door both times. *\"When I die, oh bury me deep / Down at the end of old Chestnut Street / So I can hear old Number Nine / As she comes rolling by\u2026\"* It's been several years so let me know, please, whether Lazy Jane's still has too-loud entertainment \u2014 if not, maybe I'll give them another chance.\n\n**Monty's Blue Plate Diner**. Madison seems to love this place, and the food is never disappointing but, to me, never truly great. Their leisurely opening time (7:00 AM during the week and 7:30 on weekends) makes it difficult to beat the rush, and there's always a rush. Whenever we've eaten at Monty's we've waited at least ten or fifteen minutes for a seat, sometimes longer, and because of the crowd the eventual service always seems (understandably) rushed, with little attention to detail and no hope of coffee refills. There's also something about the architecture (it's a converted gas station) that makes the restaurant almost painfully *loud* when it's busy, which is always. If the folks in the next booth (or even several booths away) are chatting even with normal \"inside voices,\" every word bounces off the wall until the sound becomes a cacophony, making breakfast at Monty's more tense than relaxing.\n\n**Ogden's North Street Diner**. I adore this place, highly recommend it, and it's right in my neighborhood. Walking distance, so I don't have to worry about parking (and that's a plus, since there's no parking lot). The food is always excellent, the ambiance is warm and welcoming, the service is sparkling, and don't forget to order their fabulous pie to go, for later. Ogden's loses points, though, for being in such a small building, since that usually means you'll wait for a seat. And it loses points for a more personal reason \u2014 it was my wife's favorite place for breakfast but she passed away, damn it, so the idea of eating at Ogden's seems sad to me now. Eliminated in the semi-finals.\n\n**The Parkway Family Restaurant**. Good selection, good breakfast, good service and the waitress will probably call you \"Honey.\" Bonus points for having the earliest opening time in town \u2014 5:00 AM \u2014 so if you wake up early you can beat the rush. Everything is consistently good but just as consistently never quite great, and coffee refills are often hoped-for more than poured. Eliminated in the quarter-finals.\n\n**Sunroom Caf\u00e9** on State Street. Recommended \u2014 quite good, borderline great, no real complaints. Eliminated in the quarter-finals.\n\nAnd as a disclaimer, let's mention a few restaurants I *haven't* tried, but have heard good things about:\n\n**Basset Street Brunch Club** \u2014 You tell me: I've heard rave reviews from some folks, and dire warnings from others, so I'm unsure and haven't yet tried it. Also, it's a Food Fight place, and I've never forgiven them for what they did to the Avenue Bar.\n\n**Circ, at the Madison Concourse Hotel**. As a firm rule, I don't dine at places where the menu lists prices with only whole numbers \u2014 dollars but no cents, and no dollar sign. From sad experience, a menu that says \"Eggs Benedict / 10\" or \"Omelettes / 13\" is a clear warning that the service, ambiance, and prices will be a bit snooty for my taste; the opposite of a relaxed, \"down home\" diner.\n\n**Bennett\u2019s Meadowood Country Club** \u2014 Folks tell me their breakfast is yummy, but they used to (perhaps still do?) serve porn with breakfast, and that's impossible to get out of my head. Not that I'd object to porn, especially since I used to work in that industry, but I prefer porn in private, not with eggs and hash browns.\n\n**Marigold Kitchen** \u2014 See **Circ**, above.\n\n**Mickie's Dairy Bar**. This place *must* be good, since there's virtually always a line of folks on the sidewalk, waiting to get in. Soon as someone goes in the door, more people join the line. And that's what's kept me away \u2014 I want to walk in and sit down, place my order, and relax sipping my coffee, but it would be hard to relax when so many people are eyeing my seat. *Does that line ever end?* I could eat a lazy, leisurely breakfast anywhere else in town, finish, tip and pay and be on my way, while I'd still be standing in line at Mickie's.\n\n**Short Stack Eatery** \u2014 I've had excellent milk shakes and malteds \"to go\" from Short Stack, but never tried their breakfast. Which is weird, since I love breakfast and that's their claim to fame. I'm put off by the perceived (but perhaps not real?) difficulty of parking in that busy area around State Street, and I've also hesitated because while they offer lots of hotcakes and scrambles, there are no omelets on the menu. Anyone can scramble eggs, but I can\u2019t make an omelet, so for breakfast at a diner I want an omelet, darn it.\n\nFor me, the showdown for the championship is between **The Curve** on Park Street, and **Pat O'Malley's Jet Room** at the airport. Who wins? Read on, if you care or if you dare:\n\nAt **The Curve**, breakfast comes quickly, it's always excellent, their coffee is the best in town and frequently refilled, the service is astoundingly homey, the waitress always calls me \"Honey\" or \"Sweetie,\" and the tab is always just a little bit less than you'd expect. The Curve does have a bit of a dingy look, especially from outside, because the windows are washed about once every other year. Other than that, though, it's hard to find anything to criticize at The Curve. Their breakfast varies between awesome and excellent. The vibe is friendly, the staff is friendly, the other customers are friendly, and the owner is frequently there and he's friendly too. So conversation is available if you're in the mood, but if you'd rather just sit and eat or read, nobody's feelings will be hurt. The experience is like eating breakfast in TV's Mayberry, but without the implied racism \u2014 people of all colors seem welcome at The Curve, as opposed to the all-white universe of *The Andy Griffith Show*.\n\nAt **Jet Room**, breakfast comes quickly too, and it's always excellent, the coffee is frequently refilled, and the service is astoundingly homey. The waitress never *specifically* calls me \"Honey\" or \"Sweetie,\" but it's always implied. The bill is perhaps a buck or two more than The Curve, but still quite reasonable, and Jet Room includes bacon or sausage with you order hotcakes, while at The Curve the hotcake stands alone, so that explains the slightly higher tab. The English muffin at Jet Room is spectacular, perhaps the best I've ever had \u2014 it's much larger than a \"standard\" English muffin, much yummier with a firmer texture, and I'd wager they make it from scratch instead of pulling it from a plastic bag. Jet Room's windows are cleaner than at The Curve, presumably because the view of the airplanes is a big attraction (and nobody really wants to see the traffic on Park Street through The Curve's window). Also, Jet Room's menu promises that the pancakes are \"light,\" and they deliver on that promise \u2014 they're light and fluffy and delicious.\n\nIt's a close call, but I prefer The Curve's \"heavier\" pancake and slightly more wonderful coffee. The Curve serves the best breakfast in Madison, for what little my opinion might be worth, and it's worth twenty bucks or so to me every Sunday morning, cash only, including a $5 tip.\n\nI'd be surprised if nobody disagrees, so \u2014 please disagree, and explain the errors of my ways."}, {"id": "a00xu6", "name": "Question about Starship Troopers (the movie).

My sincere thanks to everyone who's helped, which is basically everyone who's posted anything here over the past several years.\n\nEight pounds to go, and I'll be at my goal \u2014 my chart weight, 160 pounds. I started at 380 pounds; higher than that, actually, since I didn't step onto a scale until I'd been dieting for a few months.\n\nI lost the weight via keto for a year, and through non-keto OMAD for a couple of years. Keto worked fairly well but was difficult for me, because my wife was a terrific cook. She sometimes made accommodations for keto in her recipes, but she couldn't always do that and I couldn't resist her cooking, so I was frequently bouncing out of ketosis. OMAD has been easier, more consistent and effective, and it's going to be my lifelong strategy.\n\nWhen someone asks how I've lost the weight, I usually sidestep the question, because I'm weary of hearing ignorant sermons about how unhealthy one-meal-a-day is imagined to be. But I'll say it here:\n\nFor me, OMAD is the answer. \"Three meals a day\" was just an impossibility, because I never want to stop eating until I'm full, and if I'm full three times daily I'm going to be fat. It still astounds me how *easy* it is to eat only one meal per day (just dinner, for me), and how *huge* that one meal can be and still leave me in deficit calories.\n\nWhen I reach my weight goal (which should be 2-4 weeks from now), I'm going to continue to eat the large, filling, but healthy meals I've become accustomed to. And that will be easy, because I honestly *love* these low-calorie meals. I've invented a mimicked hamburger \u2014 in a salad instead of a bun \u2014 that's only 250 calories, and in my opinion it's better-tasting than a hamburger from a diner. I make stir-fried cauliflower rice with all sorts of easy, frozen or almost-instant stuff that makes a gigantic and delicious meal of less than a thousand calories. For dessert, I can have large quantities of low-calorie yogurt, or my awesome fried fruit compote, or the yummy (not the yucky) flavors of Halo Top.\n\nMy menu will remain the same in maintenance mode, but the calorie ceilings will be higher. I'm not even sure how to squeeze in those extra calories, as the weight-loss menu has been so filling, yummy, satisfying, and habitual for so long. But I envision treating myself to greasy, unhealthy restaurant meals once or twice per week, so long as the scale stays in balance. Man, maintenance eating is going to be luxurious, and it's so close I can almost taste it. 212 pounds down, eight pounds to go.\n\nWhat's been difficult is just rejiggering my own self-image. I've been a fat man for decades, and now I'm barely even plump, but I still hear myself making self-deprecating jokes about being a fat guy. When I say such stuff out of habit, it bewilders people who haven't known me for long. \n\nEverything is just so \u2026 different, being simply *a man* instead of *a jumbo-sized man*.\n\nIt no longer hurts my knees to climb stairs, and I no longer need to turn sideways if someone's coming the other way.\n\nI'm no longer sweaty and out of breath from walking a block.

I said yup, and she asked again, \"I mean, have you lost *a lot* of weight?\" It was my first doctor's appointment in a couple of years, so yeah, I had lost a lot of weight.\n\nI'm in the process of buying a new wardrobe. As a certified cheapskate, I put it off for a long time, and wore my XXXXL clothes as they became almost comically baggy. Some acquaintances and co-workers hadn't noticed that I was becoming slimmer, so for them the transition has seemed instantaneous. So I didn't hear many compliments while I was losing the weight, but there's been a flood of compliments now that I'm skinnier and wearing skinnier clothes.\n\nAnd my shoes don't fit. No matter how tightly I tie the laces, all my shoes are too loose. Hadn't expected that.\n\nThanks again, r/omad.

Smart idea; sit-down dining is still legally limited to 25% of capacity, and that's not economically feasible for most restaurants, so they're either closed or open only for carry-out or deliveries. There aren't many restaurants around here that *are* open for sit-down. \n\n\u2022 A lady comes in wearing a mask, in a rush to pick up her to-go order. Kirstin, the waitress \u2014 wearing a mask, too, of course \u2014 tries to be friendly but this customer will not make a single word of chit-chat. She pays, takes her bag of food in her gloved hands, and vaporizes out the door.\n\n**\"You see a lot of that, I bet,\"** says a youngish guy at the counter. \"People scared of the corona, wanting to get in and out of here quick as they can.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" says Kirstin. \"All day long, we're never as busy as we were before the bug, but I understand it. People gotta be careful.\"\n\nThere's a general murmur of *Yup*, and nobody says it but everyone's thinking, *Maybe I'm an idiot for being here*. There are only four of us idiots, in a diner that seats maybe 100. Kirstin addresses the tiny crowd: \"Anybody up for some good news?\"\n\n\"Can I get a refill please?\" says a thirty-something lady, holding her coffee cup.\n\n\"Yeah, I'll bite,\" says me. \"I could use some good news.\" My breakfast wasn't ready yet, so I'm willing to speak. My mouth has nothing better to do.\n\nKirstin pours the lady some coffee, and comes around to top off everyone's cup, while she says, \"A doctor came in yesterday for lunch. He's a regular customer, works at the hospital, but I haven't seen him since before COVID came along. He says he's been staying away because it felt unsafe. \n\n\"'Well, you're here now,' I said to him. 'Sitting down in a restaurant, not getting carry-out. Are you feeling like it's safe?'\n\n\"And he says he wouldn't say it's safe, but it's feeling safer.\n\n\"He says they're seeing about the same number of coronavirus patients as a month ago, but that their symptoms aren't as bad. Not as many need respirators, and more of them are being discharged \u2014 alive \u2014 than what he saw in April and May. He thinks the virus might have mutated into a weaker strain.\"\n\n\"Well, dang,\" says me. \"You promised good news, and that sounds like good news.\" Then my pancakes arrive, and I stop talking.\n\n\u2022 Everyone comes together at the diner \u2014 black, white, left, right, poor, not so poor, smart, not so smart. Saw a City Council member eating here once, and you also see down-and-outters occasionally.\n\nThe clientele skews old like me, so when it's politics, it's usually loud, sometimes obnoxious. This morning there's chatter about Black Lives Matter, and I'm mentally bracing for the worst. You instantly know when someone watches Fox News and they're just reciting that crapola. Today, though, the breakfast consensus is that black lives actually do matter.\n\nThere's an old white guy who always orders **\"Just hash browns, honey,\"** and I've heard him speak fluent Hannity in the past. Today he says, \"I seen a lot of whiteys at that protest, and that's a good thing. What they did to that guy, black or white, it's just wrong. Ain't no arguing about it.\"\n\nI didn't expect to hear *that*, not from that guy. Even more unexpectedly, from the context of some things he said later, that old man might have actually *been* one of the \"whiteys\" out there protesting.\n\n\u2022 Man walks in and says, **\"Can I get a hamburger, without cheese?\"**\n\nKirstin says, \"Sure, sweetie.\"\n\n\"I mean, *now*, at 6:30 in the morning? Can I get a hamburger *now*, without cheese?\"\n\n\"It'll take a few minutes, but we serve breakfast or lunch, any time.\"\n\n\"OK, thanks. I want a hamburger, without cheese. No cheese.\"\n\n~~Maybe~~ I'm a cranky old bastard, but if it has cheese it's a cheeseburger, right? If it doesn't have cheese it's a hamburger. Words have meanings, and also you don't need to repeat yourself and then repeat the repeating. I can't even mutter *Damn kids today,* because the guy looked about 50. Old enough to know better.\n\n\u2022 Later on, a black couple comes in, him and her, and they sit at the counter but a long ways from me. They order, and while waiting for their food they talk about the protests, but annoyingly, they talk very quietly, almost whispering. I could only catch a few words, never a full sentence. Usually I appreciate people who talk quietly in public, but today I was interested \u2026 but I didn't want to say, *Excuse me, could you please speak a little louder?*\n\nA skinny, youngish white guy comes in, and sits three stools from the black guy, which in pandemic times is one stool closer than I'd feel comfortable. He orders something, the couple continues quietly talking, and then skinny white guy interrupts them to say, **\"I was there for that, yeah \u2014 I saw that cop screaming at that black girl.\"**\n\nSkinny guy and black couple talked for the rest of their breakfasts and butt-bumped when the skinny guy left. Bump-bumping is the new, safer handshake or high-five.\n\n\u2022 People talk in the diner. Lord, do they talk. I enjoy some small fraction of my eavesdropping and note-taking, but generally I just wish they'd shut up.\n\nAlmost everyone opens with the weather, but one of the old-timers always leads with his health report. Soon as I see him walk in the door I know he's gonna say something about his aches and pains, and sure enough:\n\n**\"The gout's hitting me pretty hard in the knees this morning.\"** Jeez, geezer, I've got gout too, but I don't complain about it while people are eating breakfast.\n\n\u2022 Bob, the owner of the diner, looks and talks exactly like a sit-com version of a guy who owns a diner. He's gravelly-voiced, opinionated and ornery, but he's going to make sure your breakfast is to your liking. He's a nice guy, but he's the kind of nice guy who'd scowl if anyone called him a nice guy.\n\nNear as I can figure from my occasion sightings of Bob, he usually comes in at seven or so. Being the owner, if he doesn't want to work early hours he doesn't have to. Me, I'm there as soon as they unlock the door, 6AM, so I don't often see Bob, but this morning I got distracted and ran late, didn't get to the diner until 6:30.\n\nSo it's 7AM and I'm still chewing hotcakes when Bob must've entered through the back door, and he emerges from the kitchen. I say **\"Hey Bob\"** and lift my hand to wave, and he lifts his hand as he's passing my stool \u2014 and we're both thinking, *Wait, are we about to high-five, or shake hands? No friggin' way. There's a pandemic.* We both drop our hands without another word, and he passes by and takes a seat ten stools away, and asks Kirstin for steak and eggs.\n\n\u2022 After breakfast, I'm finishing my last refill of coffee, and a 30-something black guy comes in, sits on the stool closest to the door, orders something. The waitress calls him Sweetie and runs through all the 'new normal' questions \u2014 **\"Do you need salt and pepper, cream and sugar? Jelly? Ketchup?\"**\n\n\"Yes, no, yup, nope.\"\n\n\"Sorry about the Spanish Inquisition,\" she says, reaching under the counter for his requested condiments. \"We wipe everything down between every use. It's the new way of living.\"\n\n\"Better than the new way of dying,\" he says.\n\nTo be honest, I noticed this guy mostly because he wasn't just black, he's *pitch-black*, black as coal. I drain my cup, leave my payment and tip at the counter, and tell Kirstin thanks and see ya next time. As I'm walking past this guy at the corner of the counter, we make brief eye contact, and I say, \"Happy Juneteenth.\"\n\nHe half-smiles and nods, and I'm out the door second-guessing myself. Should an old white guy say 'Happy Juneteenth' to a younger black guy he doesn't know? Fuck all if I know. I wouldn't say it to a white guy, but he didn't seem offended.\n\n\u2022 Outside the building, I noticed that the YES WE'RE OPEN sign was coming loose, upside-down and hanging on only by the tape at the top, which was now the bottom of the flipped-over sign. I fold it back into its proper position, push the tape down, and step into the diner again. Kirstin says to me, **\"Back for lunch?\"**\n\nI chuckled and said, \"Maybe later. Right now, your OPEN sign is coming loose in the wind. It needs fresh tape or maybe glue instead.\"\n\nShe says thanks, and I think it over for half a second and semi-shout at her, \"Happy Juneteenth!\" And there, now I've said it to a white person, cuz *why wouldn't you* say it to white people? It's an important day for black people, but it ought to be important for everyone, right? At least, everyone who's not an idiot. \n\n*I go to the diner at dawn, before it gets busy. I wash my hands before and after, cough into my elbow, and spray Lysol on my food. I pay at my plate, tell the waitress to keep the change, and hold my breath while leaving until I'm outside. So yes, I am aware of the coronavirus, and understand that eating at the diner is somewhat more dangerous than staying in my apartment 24/7. And yet, I eat at the diner once weekly. Life without an omelet, hotcakes, and a bottomless cup of coffee would be a shitty life, so get off my lawn.*\n\n*And remember, decent people leave a generous tip.*"}, {"id": "hknspw", "name": "Breakfast at the Diner \u2014 #6", "n_comments": 10, "text": "\u2022 The first thing I noticed was that Kirstin wasn't there. She's the diner's only waitress, so when she's absent one of the cooks comes out and takes orders, pours coffee, etc. Sure enough, there's Harvey, one of the cooks, taking someone's order.\n\nI'm eyeing the situation but haven't sat down yet. It's 6:06 AM and there are more than a dozen customers, biggest crowd I've seen since the diner re-opened after three months locked up for the pandemic. Seems a lot of people are coming in as soon as the diner opens at 6:00, same as I've been doing. It's strategic; there's less risk of getting the virus if you beat the crowd, but we've become the crowd.\n\nMost customers are seated at the counter, where I want to be. Under the ever-changing rules, there are supposed to be two empty stools between every customer at the counter, couples excepted. There's only one legal stool remaining, so it's mine, and as I slide in the black man two stools to my right says, **\"You win, you get the last seat at the counter.\"**\n\n\"Yup,\" I answer. That's me, trying to be friendly.\n\n\u2022 As a waitress Harvey is a damned good cook. He's a grey-haired non-nonsense man with tattoos on his arms and a pen behind each ear, and of course, a mask on his face. To complete the look he should have a pack of cigarettes rolled into one sleeve of his t-shirt, but maybe he doesn't smoke. He approaches, nods at me, taps his pen on the counter and says **\"You want coffee?\"**\n\n\"Yup.\" I say again, but I'm thinking, *Of course I want coffee. Without coffee what's the point? Kirstin never needs to ask.*\n\n\"Today's special is kielbasa and eggs,\" he says.\n\n\"That sounds good,\" I reply. \"Can I have that as an omelet?\"\n\n\"How do you want your eggs?\" he asks.\n\nI tilt my head, confused. \"In an omelet?\"\n\n\"Easy, hard, scrambled?\"\n\n\"Uh \u2026 surprise me,\" I answer, giving up. I usually order the same omelet every time, so predictably that I'd be doxing myself if I mentioned what my usual order is. But when there's a daily special, I'll sometimes order that instead. The special, though, whatever it is, always comes with eggs and hash browns and toast. It's not available as an omelet, but Kirstin knows I'm an omelet guy, so when she tells me the daily special she always adds, \"and we can make that for you as an omelet.\" Kirstin's been breaking that rule for so many years I'd forgotten there *is* a rule. \n\nHarvey, though, plays by the rules.\n\n\u2022 This morning's multitude means more conversation than usual, most of it not worth having or hearing. Top topics are socialism (customer consensus: *no*) and space exploration (consensus: *yes*) and the ongoing protests (consensus: *maybe*). Someone asks about Fourth of July fireworks, and Harvey says, **\"Nope, the fireworks got shit-canned.\"** The old man who always complains about his medical issues comes in, takes a seat at a table 'cuz there's no room at the counter, and \u2014 guess what? \u2014 he complains about his medical issues.\n\n\u2022 A twentyish white guy comes in, wearing a Grateful Dead hoodie, with a manbun and a beard that's out of control, and he takes a table. Never seen him before but I'm thinking he's gotta be a hippie or stoner. Not that there's anything wrong with hippies or stoners, though I am skeptical of his manbun.\n\nHe seems bewildered by the concept of a menu. **\"Do you have smoothies?\"** he asks.\n\n\"You know what?\" says Harvey, not nasty but not negotiable: \"We do not have smoothies.\" He points to the beverage section of the one-page menu and says, \"You think it over, I'll be back.\"\n\n\u2022 It reminds me of the famous Honey Incident. I wasn't even there, but all the regulars know this story: Lady comes in and orders tea with honey. The answer is, **\"Honey? We don't have honey. This ain't a fancy place.\"** I don't know who said it; sounds like Harvey or Bob, the owner. All I know is, the lady gets all huffy, walks out, and she's been a punchline at the diner ever since.\n\n\u2022 The next customer is a wiry black man in ratty clothes, almost bald and what hair he's got is grey. He's \u2026 'shuffling' would be accurate, but that word has unpleasant overtones if you're describing a black person, so let's say he's dragging his shoes and walking somewhat precariously. He pulls out a chair at the table next to ManBun, but from behind the counter Harvey hollers, **\"Please take the corner table,\"** which keeps the required six-foot separation.\n\nSeems obvious that he's homeless, and yup, when Harvey comes to his table the man says, \"My money is mostly in change, but I have enough.\"\n\n\"Have you counted it?\" Harvey asks. \"I don't want to be counting ten dollars in nickels and dimes.\"\n\n\"I have it in a baggie,\" he says, and takes a big plastic bag out of his pocket, plops it loudly on the table. It's mostly coins, with a few dollar bills. \"Nine dollars and forty cents,\" he announces.\n\n\"Well, then,\" says Harvey, \"can I start you with a cup of coffee?\"\n\n\u2022 The cook \u2014 not Harvey, but a husky guy I think of as \"Slim\" \u2014 slides my breakfast in front of me without a word. It's eggs over easy, hash browns, toast, and two generous lengths of kielbasa. I've never had breakfast here that wasn't an omelet, and I'm not optimistic about this. I sigh, stab the meat, lift it to my mouth and take a bite, and what I'm thinking is, **Sweet jeebers, that's good!** I might have said it out loud.\n\nThe kielbasa is better than perfect, and better than when they've let me have it as an \"omelet special\" in the past. The eggs are also exquisite, and my perception of time and space and reality has been altered. Harvey is going to get the same tip Kirstin always gets.\n\n\u2022 Back to take the homeless man's order, Harvey opens with, **\"How about you hang on to your change, and I'll buy you eggs and toast and coffee? That's a one-time deal.\"** I'm thinking this is a Hallmark movie, as I click my pen and write it down, word for word.\n\nThe man says, \"Thanks,\" and asks for scrambled eggs and white toast, and Harvey nods and walks away. ManBun and Homeless begin a lengthy conversation, with the former frequently saying \"Excuse me?\" because the latter is slurring his words. He might be drunk, might be injured, or it might be a speech impediment.\n\nHomeless talks about how much he's missing baseball, and knows more than me about the local team. ManBun talks about the virus, and mentions that he's in a band that's performing this afternoon in an open-air fundraiser for the Bail Fund. He invites his new friend to attend, tells him where and when, and his answer is, \"Sounds cool, I'll try to be there.\"\n\n\u2022 A couple of teenagers come in, one black, one Asian, and they sit at the counter. You see some 20s people at the diner, but not many teens without parents. They're talking about the protests, and the police, and some news that didn't make the news.\n\nLast night, according to the teenagers, some wingnut drove his car not quite into some picketers but close enough to bump people and topple a few. Some of the protesters were helping the injured people, while others were banging on the car's windows, and then the cops showed up. They pepper-sprayed everyone in the protest, including people injured and on the ground, and shoved people away from the car until the wingnut could safely drive away.\n\nOne of the teenagers sums it up better than I could: **\"Yeah, let's pretend nobody knows why the protests sometimes turn violent.\"**\n\n\u2022 After Homeless and Manbun have both left, Harvey the waitress finally comes 'round to refill my coffee, and I say, **\"You know, you handled that classy.\"**\n\nHe says, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The homeless guy.\"\n\n\"Oh, him,\" he says. \"We see him once in a while when he's flush, and he always pays in change. Never any trouble. But right now, pandemic and all, I don't want his change in the register, handing it out to the next customer. Just seemed smarter to comp his bill, but Bob might be mad when he comes in.\"\n\n\"Contagious coins hadn't occurred to me,\" I said. \"Good thinking. I'm guessing Bob won't be mad.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Harvey snarls as he's walking away, \"Bob's a decent guy, but you don't want to mess with his money.\"\n\n\u2022 The restaurant is almost empty by the time I leave, which has happened the past few weeks, and I make a mental note to show up half an hour later next week. With luck, that'll be just as the beat-the-crowd crowd is leaving. The diner being busy is good for the diner, but maybe not so good for old guys like me, borderline high-risk. Or for the people who work there.\n\nWithout kind words from Kirstin, the vibe was different this morning. I even saw the bottom of my coffee cup, which never happens when she's there. I didn't ask where she was, though. That's none of my business, but I do hope Kirstin's not doing the COVID.\n\n*I'm a grumpy old man who lives alone and has few friends \u2014 basically a hermit. Once a week I have breakfast at my favorite diner. Some weeks it's my only in-person interaction with other humans, which is not my strong suit.*\n\n*Yeah, I'm aware of the coronavirus, so I go to the diner at dawn, before it gets busy. I wash my hands before and after, cough into my elbow, spray Lysol on my food, pay at my plate, tell the waitress to keep the change, and hold my breath while leaving until I'm outside. It's a little more dangerous than staying at home, but life without breakfast at the diner would be a shitty life, so get off my lawn.*\n\n*And remember, decent people leave a generous tip.*"}, {"id": "87vmm7", "name": "The (recycling) dumpster is full and overflowing.

Then comes the entree -- a pound of frozen cauliflower rice, plus a pound of chopped and frozen onions and bell peppers, plus a big chunk of chicken, beef, or fish (varies daily). If I'm still hungry after eating all that, then I'll have another *huge* salad. There are never leftovers.\n\nIf there's any downside to OMAD, at least for me, it's only that consuming one very large meal daily leads to passing one very large bowel movement daily. And my BMs are huge -- if I forget to flush half-way through, the toilet will clog. Too much information, perhaps, but I reckon my fellow OMADders will understand.\n\nTL/DR: The only drawback of OMAD is enormous poops."}, {"id": "8xrd0p", "name": "MFWTK how much sugary soda needs to be poured into an ordinary computer keyboard to render it useless.", "n_comments": 11, "text": ""}, {"id": "fymfpf", "name": "Frozen cauliflower hash browns", "n_comments": 29, "text": "OK, I'm a fat lazy bachelor, now eating somewhat healthy but still lots, and I miss hash browned potatoes.

He had already sneezed several times a few minutes earlier, so everyone's eyeballing him, even the people pretending they're not. He sneezes again, and a lady seated nearby asks for her breakfast in a box, waits impatiently for the styrofoam while this guy sneezes twice more.\n\nI'm twenty stools away, but the counter is U-shaped so I'm opposite the sneezer, facing him directly, with only a coffee pot and the waitress between us. He sneezes again. The waitress, wearing a mask, says something to someone in the back room while the sneezer sneezes twice more.\n\nA masked man in an apron emerges from the kitchen, carrying a to-go container. \"I'm gonna ask you to leave,\" he says. The sneezer shakes his head 'yes', and the cook slides his breakfast from the plate to the carry-out box, shuts the box's lid, and gently but firmly 'helps' the customer up off the stool. One last sneeze and the sneezer is out the door.\n\n**\"Adios, motherfucker,\"** says the cook after the door closes. There are some light chuckles, and tense customers. The cook walks back to the kitchen, and the diner is quiet enough you can hear him washing his hands. \n\nAnother customer asks for a box, and then he's gone, too. The diner is emptier than it was, both five minutes ago and three months ago.\n\n\u2022 Now there's just me and one other old guy eating his eggs, so the waitress talks with him, and then with me, and it makes me wish there were more customers. I'm here to eat and eavesdrop, not to talk. But she has a story to tell, which I'll re-tell. The waitress needs a name, though, so let's call her Kirstin, which is not her name.\n\nWhile the diner was closed by the coronavirus lockdown, Kirstin says she got a phone call from Bob (which is not *his* name, either), the owner of the diner. He asked her, **\"Why aren't you taking Unemployment?\"**\n\n\"Because I don't need it,\" she said. \"My husband and I have money in the bank.\"\n\nBob argued with her on the phone, not mean or angry, just insistent. \"Look,\" he said, \"you're entitled to it. You've been taxed for Unemployment coverage for years, and you're past your probationary period at the diner so I'm never going to fire you. This is your only chance to get a payout after all you've paid in. Please start filing for Unemployment.\" Kirstin said sure, so she filed, a month after the diner was closed and a month before it re-opened.\n\nThe story struck me on two counts. First off, the owner's wisecrack about Kirstin's \"probationary period\" at the diner? Well, she's been working there since the 1990s. Kirstin kinda *is* the diner \u2014 if it's your first or second visit you're \"Sweetie,\" but after that she probably knows you by name and you can order \"the usual.\" Which is amazing, because there must be 500 regulars at the diner, once-a-weekers like me, and everyday eaters and once-a-monthers, and somehow any of us can say \"the usual, please,\" and Kirstin will bring exactly what's wanted, plus refills of coffee.\n\nSecond, and almost as impressive, Bob pays part of any Unemployment claim. That's the way the system works. I'm not sure how he knew that Kirstin hadn't filed, but when he called and asked her to file for Unemployment, he was asking Kirstin to raise his taxes. I'd wager no-one who works at Denny's got a phone call like that during the lockdown.\n\n~~~\n\n*I go to the diner at dawn, before it gets busy.

Neither of them knows much about what's going on but that doesn't keep them from talking about it, saying things the young guy probably heard on TV and the old guy might have read in a newspaper. \"They tore down the statues, even the statue of that guy who fought against slavery in the 1800s.\" \u2026 \"I'm awfully tired of seeing all the businesses boarded up.\" \u2026 \"I don't even understand what the protesters want.\" \u2026\n\nNow I'm nearing my limit for how much stupidity I can stand, but I've lost every fistfight I've ever been in, so I bite my tongue and bite my omelet.

Saul gives the guy a ten-second stare, then opens his mouth to say something, but doesn't. Instead he takes a deep breath, lets out a ridiculously long sigh, and starts talking to the waitress about baseball.\n\n\u2022 Two middle-aged men, one white, one black, are eating alone, sitting ten stools apart, but they want to talk with each other so they're talking *loud*, about the weather and their weekend plans. At some point there's a lull in the conversation, and both of them turn their heads a bit and for a moment all three of us are making eye contact. I give 'em each half a smile, which I guess adds up to a complete smile, and then avert my eyes back to my breakfast and magazine. Eye contact is way too much contact for me.\n\nThe black guy, after his fourth or fifth cup of coffee, has a sudden urge to take a pee. I know this because he says, **\"I have a sudden urge to take a pee,\"** before he gets up and disappears down the hall into the men's room.

He's another familiar face, and he makes the same sour, drawn-out entrance every time I see him. With the addition of caffeine to his bloodstream, he evolves from grumpy-but-quiet to grumpy-but-chatty, and after half an hour his grumpiness fades and he's just chatty and annoying. As always.\n\nThis morning as he pays his bill, he offers a parting thought: \"There's nothing about any of this coronavirus crap that doesn't stink, but we'll come through. And some of us won't come through, but that's OK too. The world will get along without us.\" And then he's gone.

You might have to wave your hands or holler if you need ketchup or cream.\n\nKirstin brings breakfast to a middle-aged black lady at one of the tables, and says **\"Enjoy your meal.\"** Then she bustles back behind the counter, and does all her ordinary tasks \u2014 washes a few dishes, pours more coffee for everyone, takes another order, etc. When there's finally a lull in her waitress-work, the lady at the table says, \"Excuse me, could I please have some salt and pepper when you have a minute?\" Couldn't be more courteous.\n\nKirstin comes quickly with fresh and clean shakers, and she's very apologetic. \"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" she says, \"and it looks like you've already had several bites of your eggs. You can always shout if you need something. I'm always listening, even if I'm busy or in the back.\"\n\nThe customer says, \"Ah, no worries, Kirstin. I could see you were busy. You're not just standing around playing solitary.\"\n\nSo here we have a couple of nice ladies being kind and considerate to each other, a microcosm of the world as it should be, yet all I can think is, *Playing solitary? No, the game is solitaire.* Long ago in another city, another life, I was an editor, and whether I'm reading or listening, I still second-guess bad grammar and incorrect syntax and usage.

But what the hell, I'm a thousand miles away and I wanted to see my siblings and nieces and nephews in a *Brady Bunch* format, so I installed Zoom on my laptop.\n\nI'll skip writing a review about the ordinary technical glitches, and how half of every conversation seems to be everyone saying \"I can't see you\" and \"Mike dropped off,\" and how the sound was so unreliable that I often used the \"chat\" function instead of actually chatting. All that's beside the point.\n\nWhat you need to know is that I don't like to be on camera. My apartment is a mess, I'm a mess, and I'm usually sitting here in my underwear, or less. I'm an introvert, so I simply never invite anyone into my home, and inviting a *camera* into my home falls under the same rule, so \u2014 nope. That's why I installed Zoom on a computer that doesn't have a camera, leaving no possibility that anyone could see anything I don't want them to see. Or so I thought.\n\nInstead, I found an [amusing picture](https://imgur.com/a/dHcvNtB) online, of someone even older and uglier than me, and added that as my Zoom profile picture. When I Zoomed with my family, I could see and hear everyone, and they could hear me, but they could only see the old coot. Our first three Zooms, everything went fine except for the ordinary glitches that seem to plague every Zoom meeting.\n\nOur fourth family Zoom was tonight. We're chatting as usual, and as usual I'm not saying much because like I said, I'm an introvert. On the big tic-tac-toe board, top-left is my brother, top-center is an old friend, and top-right is my silly photo of the unknown old man. The middle and bottom rows are my mother, my sister, a nephew and a couple of my nieces. It's all very wholesome.\n\nThen without warning, without me touching anything, my on-screen photo of the old coot is gone. Instead it's [this silly meme](https://imgur.com/a/m0xEXS4) from the sidebar of r/LazyCheapskate. The photo and the meme are both on my computer, but they're not even in the same folder, and I never uploaded the meme to Zoom.\n\nMy sister and nephew are reading the meme outloud, wondering what it means and what happened to the photo. My Mom says, \"Well, that doesn't look 'successful' to me.\" And I'm thinking of all the other JPGs and MP4s on my computer that Zoom could've helped itself to and shared with my family \u2014 including my sizable collection of pornography. After several seconds in shock, I closed the program, exiting the conversation without another word.\n\nIf Zoom had put porn on the screen instead of a meme, I'd never have heard the end of it from my mega-religious mother and brother. It actually gave me goose bumps, and not in a fun way. I sent the family a quick email announcing my resignation from Zoom, and uninstalled the program.\n\nThis just in: *Zoom has certainly not solved all of its security issues.* Zoom is capable of replacing your profile picture with, apparently, any random file from your computer, without permission, without warning, without any user action at all.\n\nSweet jeebers.

Two months without omelets and pancakes and a bottomless cup of coffee was the pandemic's biggest impact on my lousy life, besides working from home and my brother's hospitalization and the death of an old man I've known since I was a kid.\n\nThe diner is open again, limited to 25% of their seating capacity, and I had breakfast at the counter this morning. Did I worry? Of course, but if you live your life entirely without risk, that ain't much of a life. And I'm usually there early, before there's any crowd, so I had hoped it would seem safe ... or safe enough. \n\nThe owner is a gruff, no-nonsense, gravelly-voiced guy \u2014 and maybe the kind of man who'd poo-poo the pandemic precautions? The closest he's come to discussing politics with me was when he brusquely said, \"I don't like to discuss politics,\" so I was a little concerned.\n\nHappy to report, though, that they're doing everything safe and smart. The staff wore masks. The tables were devoid of condiments; I had to ask for salt and pepper and cream for my coffee and ketchup for my hash browns, and each container was wiped with a bleachy solution before it was placed on the counter. The waitress, always masked, came within six feet only when passing by, or when pouring my coffee. When I finished my meal, she took the menu that had been near me and gave it a thorough wipe-down, even though I hadn't touched it (it's the kind of place where regular customers order \"the usual\").\n\nI was more worried about the dangers of eating inside a restaurant *before* eating inside the restaurant, than *afterwards*. Everything about breakfast felt safer than my visit to the Post Office a few weeks ago, and less risky than shopping in a grocery store or going to my workplace.\n\nKey to having a worry-free restaurant experience during the apocalypse, though, is to go during off-peak hours. Google has a helpful feature that shows how busy a restaurant usually is at any given time; I couldn't find a direct link, but [click here](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=the+curve+Madison) and scroll down to the blue \"Popular times\" graph, on the right. \n\nAt this diner, they're open at 6AM, but on weekdays it's never busy until a little before 7 \u2014 notice, on the graph, there isn't any blue between 6AM and 7AM. There was one other customer when I arrived, and one other when I left at 6:45, and in between it was only me for about twenty minutes.\n\nSo, **bottom line and TL/DR**:  You don't have to wait six months to enjoy a restaurant meal inside a restaurant, if you choose a well-run business and avoid their busiest times.\n\nAlso, decent people leave a generous tip."}, {"id": "dxn89r", "name": "Do you have an aura that says \"Leave me alone\"?", "n_comments": 12, "text": "Ate breakfast at a diner this morning, and the place was unusually empty.

She's the diner's only waitress, so when she's absent one of the cooks comes out and takes orders, pours coffee, etc. Sure enough, there's Harvey, one of the cooks, taking someone's order.\n\nI'm eyeing the situation but haven't sat down yet. It's 6:06 AM and there are more than a dozen customers, biggest crowd I've seen since the diner re-opened after three months locked up for the pandemic. Seems a lot of people are coming in as soon as the diner opens at 6:00, same as I've been doing. It's strategic; there's less risk of getting the virus if you beat the crowd, but we've become the crowd.\n\nMost customers are seated at the counter, where I want to be. Under the ever-changing rules, there are supposed to be two empty stools between every customer at the counter, couples excepted. There's only one legal stool remaining, so it's mine, and as I slide in the black man two stools to my right says, **\"You win, you get the last seat at the counter.\"**\n\n\"Yup,\" I answer. That's me, trying to be friendly.\n\n\u2022 As a waitress Harvey is a damned good cook. He's a grey-haired non-nonsense man with tattoos on his arms and a pen behind each ear, and of course, a mask on his face. To complete the look he should have a pack of cigarettes rolled into one sleeve of his t-shirt, but maybe he doesn't smoke. He approaches, nods at me, taps his pen on the counter and says **\"You want coffee?\"**\n\n\"Yup.\" I say again, but I'm thinking, *Of course I want coffee. Without coffee what's the point? Kirstin never needs to ask.*\n\n\"Today's special is kielbasa and eggs,\" he says.\n\n\"That sounds good,\" I reply. \"Can I have that as an omelet?\"\n\n\"How do you want your eggs?\" he asks.\n\nI tilt my head, confused. \"In an omelet?\"\n\n\"Easy, hard, scrambled?\"\n\n\"Uh \u2026 surprise me,\" I answer, giving up. I usually order the same omelet every time, so predictably that I'd be doxing myself if I mentioned what my usual order is. But when there's a daily special, I'll sometimes order that instead. The special, though, whatever it is, always comes with eggs and hash browns and toast. It's not available as an omelet, but Kirstin knows I'm an omelet guy, so when she tells me the daily special she always adds, \"and we can make that for you as an omelet.\" Kirstin's been breaking that rule for so many years I'd forgotten there *is* a rule. \n\nHarvey, though, plays by the rules.\n\n\u2022 This morning's multitude means more conversation than usual, most of it not worth having or hearing. Top topics are socialism (customer consensus: *no*) and space exploration (consensus: *yes*) and the ongoing protests (consensus: *maybe*). Someone asks about Fourth of July fireworks, and Harvey says, **\"Nope, the fireworks got shit-canned.\"** The old man who always complains about his medical issues comes in, takes a seat at a table 'cuz there's no room at the counter, and \u2014 guess what? \u2014 he complains about his medical issues.\n\n\u2022 A twentyish white guy comes in, wearing a Grateful Dead hoodie, with a manbun and a beard that's out of control, and he takes a table. Never seen him before but I'm thinking he's gotta be a hippie or stoner. Not that there's anything wrong with hippies or stoners, though I am skeptical of his manbun.\n\nHe seems bewildered by the concept of a menu. **\"Do you have smoothies?\"** he asks.\n\n\"You know what?\" says Harvey, not nasty but not negotiable: \"We do not have smoothies.\" He points to the beverage section of the one-page menu and says, \"You think it over, I'll be back.\"\n\n\u2022 It reminds me of the famous Honey Incident. I wasn't even there, but all the regulars know this story: Lady comes in and orders tea with honey. The answer is, **\"Honey? We don't have honey. This ain't a fancy place.\"** I don't know who said it; sounds like Harvey or Bob, the owner. All I know is, the lady gets all huffy, walks out, and she's been a punchline at the diner ever since.\n\n\u2022 The next customer is a wiry black man in ratty clothes, almost bald and what hair he's got is grey. He's \u2026 'shuffling' would be accurate, but that word has unpleasant overtones if you're describing a black person, so let's say he's dragging his shoes and walking somewhat precariously. He pulls out a chair at the table next to ManBun, but from behind the counter Harvey hollers, **\"Please take the corner table,\"** which keeps the required six-foot separation.\n\nSeems obvious that he's homeless, and yup, when Harvey comes to his table the man says, \"My money is mostly in change, but I have enough.\"\n\n\"Have you counted it?\" Harvey asks. \"I don't want to be counting ten dollars in nickels and dimes.\"\n\n\"I have it in a baggie,\" he says, and takes a big plastic bag out of his pocket, plops it loudly on the table. It's mostly coins, with a few dollar bills. \"Nine dollars and forty cents,\" he announces.\n\n\"Well, then,\" says Harvey, \"can I start you with a cup of coffee?\"\n\n\u2022 The cook \u2014 not Harvey, but a husky guy I think of as \"Slim\" \u2014 slides my breakfast in front of me without a word. It's eggs over easy, hash browns, toast, and two generous lengths of kielbasa. I've never had breakfast here that wasn't an omelet, and I'm not optimistic about this. I sigh, stab the meat, lift it to my mouth and take a bite, and what I'm thinking is, **Sweet jeebers, that's good!** I might have said it out loud.\n\nThe kielbasa is better than perfect, and better than when they've let me have it as an \"omelet special\" in the past. The eggs are also exquisite, and my perception of time and space and reality has been altered. Harvey is going to get the same tip Kirstin always gets.\n\n\u2022 Back to take the homeless man's order, Harvey opens with, **\"How about you hang on to your change, and I'll buy you eggs and toast and coffee? That's a one-time deal.\"** I'm thinking this is a Hallmark movie, as I click my pen and write it down, word for word.\n\nThe man says, \"Thanks,\" and asks for scrambled eggs and white toast, and Harvey nods and walks away. ManBun and Homeless begin a lengthy conversation, with the former frequently saying \"Excuse me?\" because the latter is slurring his words. He might be drunk, might be injured, or it might be a speech impediment.\n\nHomeless talks about how much he's missing baseball, and knows more than me about the local team. ManBun talks about the virus, and mentions that he's in a band that's performing this afternoon in an open-air fundraiser for the Bail Fund. He invites his new friend to attend, tells him where and when, and his answer is, \"Sounds cool, I'll try to be there.\"\n\n\u2022 A couple of teenagers come in, one black, one Asian, and they sit at the counter. You see some 20s people at the diner, but not many teens without parents. They're talking about the protests, and the police, and some news that didn't make the news.\n\nLast night, according to the teenagers, some wingnut drove his car not quite into some picketers but close enough to bump people and topple a few. Some of the protesters were helping the injured people, while others were banging on the car's windows, and then the cops showed up. They pepper-sprayed everyone in the protest, including people injured and on the ground, and shoved people away from the car until the wingnut could safely drive away.\n\nOne of the teenagers sums it up better than I could: **\"Yeah, let's pretend nobody knows why the protests sometimes turn violent.\"**\n\n\u2022 After Homeless and Manbun have both left, Harvey the waitress finally comes 'round to refill my coffee, and I say, **\"You know, you handled that classy.\"**\n\nHe says, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The homeless guy.\"\n\n\"Oh, him,\" he says. \"We see him once in a while when he's flush, and he always pays in change. Never any trouble. But right now, pandemic and all, I don't want his change in the register, handing it out to the next customer. Just seemed smarter to comp his bill, but Bob might be mad when he comes in.\"\n\n\"Contagious coins hadn't occurred to me,\" I said. \"Good thinking. I'm guessing Bob won't be mad.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Harvey snarls as he's walking away, \"Bob's a decent guy, but you don't want to mess with his money.\"\n\n\u2022 The restaurant is almost empty by the time I leave, which has happened the past few weeks, and I make a mental note to show up half an hour later next week. With luck, that'll be just as the beat-the-crowd crowd is leaving. The diner being busy is good for the diner, but maybe not so good for old guys like me, borderline high-risk. Or for the people who work there.\n\nWithout kind words from Kirstin, the vibe was different this morning. I even saw the bottom of my coffee cup, which never happens when she's there. I didn't ask where she was, though. That's none of my business, but I do hope Kirstin's not doing the COVID.\n\n*I'm a grumpy old man who lives alone and has few friends \u2014 basically a hermit. Once a week I have breakfast at my favorite diner. Some weeks it's my only in-person interaction with other humans, which is not my strong suit.*\n\n*Yeah, I'm aware of the coronavirus, so I go to the diner at dawn, before it gets busy. I wash my hands before and after, cough into my elbow, spray Lysol on my food, pay at my plate, tell the waitress to keep the change, and hold my breath while leaving until I'm outside. It's a little more dangerous than staying at home, but life without breakfast at the diner would be a shitty life, so get off my lawn.*\n\n*And remember, decent people leave a generous tip.*"}, {"id": "gtyyxl", "name": "Fuck off, President Trump", "n_comments": 6, "text": "[TL/DR?

If you *must* have a conversation you'd prefer to avoid, it'll at least be a briefer chat than it might have been pre-pandemic.\n\n\u2022 For people who've been laid off or locked down, it's a golden opportunity to de-stress from all the worries of work or school \u2014 provided you're not stressing too much about the virus.\n\n\u2022 Most of us are able to go for a walk more often, especially if we're working at home or unemployed. I've always found that a quiet walk alone helps with almost any problem \u2014 well, except for foot pain, or if loneliness is the problem.\n\n\u2022 You're washing your hands more often, right? Counting to twenty or singing Happy Birthday, scrubbing between the fingers, rub a dub-dub and all. If we keep doing that, make it a habit even after the coronavirus crisis is over, we'll be healthier for years to come.\n\n\u2022 Wearing a mask in public means you can't see that I'm not smiling, at moments when social protocol suggests I should be.\n\n\u2022 No more meetings at work, at least not in person. Meetings are boring, counterproductive, and always an opportunity to say the wrong thing in front of your boss or co-workers. No meetings? No problem!\n\n\u2022 Philosophically and morally, it's heartening to know that we shut down the world and crippled the economy to save a lot of lives. It isn't often that humanity comes together to do something smart, but if we hadn't gone into lockdown mode, the death toll would have been much, much higher. *Excellent work, humans.

Because the laundry room in my apartment building is gross, it's a long walk down the hall and down the stairs, the washing machines always leave white streaks on my dark clothes, and doing laundry in the tub saves a few bucks.\n\nMy shower/laundry loads are usually very light \u2014 a few pair of underwear and socks, maybe a shirt or pants if they're starting to smell funky. All clothes should form just one layer across the bottom of the tub; if it's deeper than that you're not going to get them very clean.\n\nThen shower as usual, but keep walking on your clothes under the running water. The soapy lather from washing your hair and limbs and genitals will be enough to get your clothes clean, provided that you keep walking on the wet clothes like you're stomping grapes to make wine. Keep walking for as long as you're in the shower.\n\nWhen I first started washing some clothes in the shower, I tried using a blop of detergent and/or my bar of soap, but it makes no difference in how clean the clothes look, smell, or feel. So it's not needed. Actually, using detergent or soap necessitates extra rinsing effort, which defeats the whole concept of lazy \u2014 am I right? \n\nThe only extra effort required is, when you'd otherwise be done showering, briefly wring out the clothes. Just twist them in your hands to get most of the water out. The more you wring, the quicker they'll dry, and if you don't wring enough they might get mildewy. But take it easy; you only need to wring things enough so that they're just dripping occasionally, not raining or drizzling.\n\nDry-time is a day or so. Hang the wet clothes where the drips won't make a mess or do damage \u2014 your front porch, maybe, or directly over the cat's water bowl?

Second thing in the morning instead of first, and indeed, there were fewer customers and more empty seats. Looking around the room, I notice two 20-something white men, but only because they're sitting with a gorgeous redhead who seems somewhat overdressed, like she's headed to the opera after she's eaten her low-budget breakfast.\n\nThe diner's regular clientele includes at least two old men who use walkers to get around. One is bald and frightfully thin, and the other has more flab like me and an amazing bouffant of silver hair rising maybe six inches straight up from his forehead, kinda like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/25/fd/4625fd4f70ab1d4227c3805294a069bb.jpg) but with wrinkles and gray hair. Bald-Walker is at a table way down at the other end of the room, but Bouffant-Walker is sitting at a counter stool, and he's left his walker blocking the rather narrow walkway.\n\nMy wife used a walker for a while before she died, so I'm familiar with the mechanics and necessities, and I can't and don't begrudge him for blocking the aisle. A walker needs to be within arm's reach, and while it does take less space if it's folded, it's a *bitch* folding and unfolding a walker. So I only say, **\"'Scuse me, mister,\"** and squeeze between him and his walker, brushing up against both, to take my favorite seat at the end of the counter.\n\n\u2022 Actually, the coffee tells me where to sit. Kirstin knows which seat I like, and she fills my cup while I'm gently bumping  past walker-guy. She puts cream on the counter for me, too.\n\n**\"Morning, sweetie,\"** she says. \"Our special today is huevos rancheros, and we can make that for you as an omelet if you'd like.\" She says this while she's setting up exactly the jelly, salt and pepper, ketchup, and ice water I never even have to ask for.\n\n\"Sounds good,\" I answer, \"but I'll have my usual, please.\"\n\nKirstin recites my order from memory, gets it exactly right, and jots it in shorthand on one of those ubiquitous green tickets, which she passes to the guys in the kitchen. I am glad she's back, and glad she's healthy, but I don't say so. An hour later, on my way home, I wonder why I didn't say so, but I know I won't say it next week either.\n\n\u2022 A black man comes in, young and muscular and looks like an underwear model but he's wearing clothes. Kirstin greets him by name, same as she seems to know everyone by their second time in the restaurant. She takes his order, and it's a little complicated. No onions in his omelet, no butter on his toast, and such quibbles. Kirstin takes it all down with no difficulties.\n\nCouple of minutes later, Harvey the cook can't be seen, but his voice calls out from the kitchen, **\"Hey, about this Denver omelet?\"**\n\nThere are so few customers, Underwear-Model knows that's his order, and he says, \"Yeah? I'm a Denver omelet,\" which makes me giggle. He glances at me, and giggles a little himself.\n\nVoice from the kitchen: \"You wanted no butter on your toast, so are you OK with butter on the grill for your omelet?\"\n\n\"I'm not allergic,\" he says, \"Do whatever you think best.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a dangerous thing to say,\" says Harvey's voice from behind the wall. \"I might fry your omelet in mayo and tartar sauce.\"\n\n\u2022 With only a handful of people scattered inside the diner and nobody near me, for a while there was only one customer' whose yakking was inescapable. **\"She's so annoying,\"** some yuppie-guy starts, and instantly you know he's going to be annoying.\n\nSure enough, he says something dumb and dull every few minutes, before his food comes and while he's eating and after his plate is taken away. He's broadcasting, not talking to anyone in particular. Not a word of what he said was interesting, but now we all know everything about his sister-in-law. He says he hates her, but I think he's secretly in love.\n\n\u2022 Being a man, I sneak an occasionally gander at that pretty and swanky-dressed woman down the counter. I'm not being creepy about it, promise, it's just \u2014 dang.\n\nI'm ignoring her two male companions but she's not, and I'm wondering what's the dynamic there? She's flirting with them both. Man to her left says something, and she says, **\"Wouldn't you like to know?\"** Man to her right says something, and she just giggles. She's mid- to late-20s, a little old to be so giggly, but I'm not typing that with a sneer. Just reporting the facts.\n\n\u2022 A thirty-ish white guy named Phil is one of the regulars, and he asks Kirstin the question I didn't ask. **\"So where the hell were you last week?\"** \n\n\"Business is slow,\" she explains, \"so we're all working four days a week instead of five.\"\n\nBouffant-Walker pipes up, \"Well, this place is like eating out of my armpit when you're gone.\" Laughter.\n\n\"Yeah,\" says Phil. \"You ought to post a schedule or something, so we'll know what mornings to avoid.\"\n\n\"My apologies for the armpit,\" Kirstin deadpans, \"and next week I'll be off on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Please make a note of it.\"\n\n\u2022 I'm literally making a note of it. Several times during any meal at the diner, I put down my fork and lift my pen to scribble something in the margins of my magazine. At my age, the memory's too feeble to write something like this without notes.\n\nWonder what I'll say one of these mornings, when someone asks what I'm writing, and why? **\"Oh, I just like jotting down the stupid things strangers say in the diner \u2014 like what you just said.\"** Yeah, that'll win me some friends and influence people. That question *will* be asked one day, I suppose, so I'll need an answer that won't get me beat up. Put that on my to-do list.\n\n\u2022 For about a minute and a half out of nowhere, me and Bouffant-Walker and Underwear-Model are having a three-way conversation. We're talking about what's open and what's closed for COVID-19, and Underwear-Model says, **\"The parks are all open, but in some parks the restrooms are padlocked.\"**\n\n\"No staff to clean the place,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, that's a problem,\" says Bouffant. \"That could ruin a picnic.\"\n\nAnd here comes one of the longest sentences I've spoken out loud in months: \"They can tell me to wear a mask, but they can't order me not to take a dump.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" says Underwear-Model. \"When you gotta go you gotta go, like a bear in the woods.\"\n\n\"I assume you mean the Chicago Bears,\" I say, and they both laugh.\n\nThat's me faking social skills, but I don't care about the Chicago Bears, or about football. This is Wisconsin, where even I know, if you want to get a laugh you say something bad about the Bears.\n\n\u2022 Someone is talking about the pandemic rules and regulations, and Kirstin says, **\"We can't have more than ten\\* customers inside at once,\"** and then she looks around the almost empty room and adds for laughs, **\"which is seldom a problem.\"** Business at the diner is not what it was before the coronavirus, that's obvious. If anyone's reading this, please support your local restaurants that don't have golden arches.\n\n\u2022 And sadly, there she goes. I've been occasionally but discreetly observing that woman, but now she and her two men are leaving. They slide masks onto their faces, and she pays the tab for all three of them and says, **\"Thank you.\"** Which means, they're not regulars; else she would've said, \"Thank you, Kirstin.\"\n\nOnce out the door, she walks past the diner's front window, accompanied by only one of her men. The other must have walked toward the parking lot, in the other direction, which saddens my prurient imagination. I was hoping all three of them would have a delightful morning, but as they say, two out of three ain't bad.\n\n\u2022 No new customers step through the door for several minutes, so there's nothing the kitchen needs to cook, and Harvey plays the overnight's accumulated messages off the answering machine. I'm at a stool twenty feet away, but the machine puts out good sound. Everyone in the diner hears every word, clear as a landline.\n\nThe first call is about a delivery truck that's coming tomorrow.\n\nThe second call is someone ordering two meals for pick-up, steak and potato and a fish sandwich, specific sides and sodas, and the voice finishes by saying he'll be there at around 4:00. The machine's timestamp announces says that they called yesterday at about three. Thing is, the diner closes at 1:00, every day. **\"Hope you enjoyed your meal,\"** Harvey says with a chortle. **\"Come back soon!\"** He pushes a button and the answering machine's mechanical voice says, \"Message deleted.\"\n\nThe third call is personal, so I won't repeat the details, but Slim is out of luck for the weekend, and his \"Damn it!\" carries from the back room.\n\n\u2022 Bouffant-Walker is still on a stool when I leave, and his walker is still in the aisle. His breakfast is gone but his coffee isn't, and Kirstin is pouring more. Maybe he's going to ride that stool all day. **\"Adios,\"** I say as I squeeze past and unavoidably nudge him again.\n\n\"So long,\" he says. \"Wash your hands and stay alive.\"\n\n\"That's exactly my plan.\"\n\n\\**Correction:* Due to the pandemic, restaurants are currently limited to 25% of capacity, so Kirstin's comment that the diner is limited to ten customers at once means it seats forty or so. Scanned the room and verified my math. A few weeks ago I guesstimated that the diner seats a hundred, but I was as wrong as sin on Sunday. r/LazyCheapskate regrets the error.\n\n*I'm a grumpy old man who lives alone and has few friends \u2014 basically a hermit. Once a week I have breakfast at my favorite diner. Some weeks it's my only in-person interaction with other humans, which is not my strong suit.*\n\n*Yeah, I'm aware of the coronavirus, so I go to the diner at dawn, before it gets busy. I wash my hands before and after, cough into my elbow, spray Lysol on my food, pay at my plate, tell the waitress to keep the change, and hold my breath while leaving until I'm outside. It's a little more dangerous than staying at home, but life without breakfast at the diner would be a shitty life, so get off my lawn.*\n\n*And remember, decent people leave a generous tip.*"}, {"id": "h09dq8", "name": "Say something nice", "n_comments": 3, "text": "\"Good morning!\" I'll say it at work, and sincerely mean it, but that's as far as it goes. I'd really rather not have a ten-minute conversation about your weekend or mine. Your spawn had a play-date with the neighbor's kids? You binge-watched *The Sopranos*? That's nice, but I don't give a damn. And let's be honest, you also don't give a damn what I did over the weekend, so let's just say \"Good morning\" and get on with the day.\n\nDue to my perfectly reasonable disdain for dumb chit-chat, some people mistakenly think I'm a grump, or that I despise them. Actually, though, I'm usually in a good spirits *because* I avoid the chit-chat, and I like my co-workers *because* I know so little about who they really are. \n\nTo battle the misconception that I'm a rat-bastard, I'll sometimes try \u2014 not try hard, but try \u2014 to say something nice. \"Oh, you got a haircut, it looks nice.\" Turns out she had her hair restyled last October. Saying something nice is difficult, but I keep trying. Last week I told a co-worker that he's smart, which is way, way out of my ordinary emotional wheelhouse. \n\nSee, I'm inward, not outward. I've embraced my introversion. All invitations will be cordially declined. I have nothing to say unless I have something to say, which doesn't happen often. Social situations, or anything remotely akin to social situations, leave me scratching my head, unsure what to do, usually doing nothing or apologizing after doing the wrong thing.\n\nNow the coronavirus is attacking Lizzie, someone I know and like from the office. She's a borderline-friend, one of very few people in the building I've had non-work-related conversations with, without regretting every word spoken and heard. I'd prefer that she doesn't die. Do they make a Hallmark card for that?\n\nWanted to say something, but I don\u2019t know her cell number or email address or social media handle or which hospital she's in, or much of anything else. All I know is, her sister works in a different department at the same company, so I sent this email to her sister:\n\n> Privacy is almost always my policy, especially at work, so it\u2019s none of my business and I don't want to know.\n> All I ask is, if you speak with your sister Lizzie, please tell her that she is liked, respected, missed, and worried about, by me at least. Can\u2019t speak for anyone else in the office.\n> \n> That\u2019s all. Over and out.\n\nThis sister, a stranger to me, replied via email half an hour later, telling me all the myriad disgusting health details I\u2019d *specifically* asked not to know. Sigh. They're not sure whether she'll survive.\n\nAt least my message has been relayed to Lizzie, and her sister said it was appreciated, and that Lizzie sends me \u201ca big fat e-hug,\u201d so I guess it did both of us some good.\n\nYou know the clich\u00e9s: You get one life to live, one chance to make a first impression, blah blah blah. In a pandemic, you get one chance to make a *last* impression.

I didn't want to mess with wrenches and plumbing, and I didn't want to spend serious money, so I bought this [hand-held squeeze-bidet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081V88Z7Q/).\n\nIt's basically a squirt gun for your butt, with a 17-ounce reservoir, and a long nozzle that reaches where it needs to. You fill it at the sink before sitting down, so you decide the temperature (I like the water piping-hot). $15.49 buys *two bidets*, so you have a back-up bidet on the floor if the bidet in your hand goes dry.\n\nThe biggest news for me, something I've never heard anyone mention, is that with paper wiping, you'll sometimes get stuff on your fingers and hands. With a bidet, that simply doesn't happen \u2014 your hands only touch the squeezable bidet, so you can skip washing up afterwards unless you're hyper about hygiene. Also, nobody ever said wiping is enjoyable, but using a bidet is actually, honestly, kind of fun. *Whoosh! Whoosh!*\n\nThe bidet's efficiency varies with the consistency of your poop. If it's fairly firm, a few blasts with the squeeze-bidet and you're tidy. If it's more slushy, you should make sure your cheeks are spread as far as comfortably possible when you sit down. Loose bowels with parted cheeks: 4-6 blasts. Loose bowels without fully-parted cheeks: 8-10 blasts. Each of these cheap plastic bidets hold enough water for 10-12 blasts, so even if the situation is messy you'll have plenty of water. To be honest, though, if it's messy under there, I'll start by wiping the old-fashioned way, and then use the bidet.\n\nThis bidet is easier and less disgusting than wiping. It *really* blasts out the water, too. I've tested its effectiveness by wiping after the bidet-rinse, and seen only a tiny amount of \"residoodoo\" \u2014 and that was after a particularly messy poop. An expert told me that some slight leftovers are not uncommon for a bidet rookie, but that with practice there will be less left behind.\n\nEach bidet has a rubbery washer, so there are no leaks, even when it's upside-down. The plastic isn't brittle, and it's survived several drops onto the tile floor. The nozzle is long enough and smartly shaped, so access is easy. The tip, where the water comes out, has half a dozen tiny openings, so you get numerous streams, not just one, which makes it easy to hit the intended target. Can't think of any complaints, really, except that it came overpackaged with too much tape and plastic and a couple of \"carrying bags\" I'll never use.\n\nBottom line: I don't regret the purchase, and I'm happy with my cheap plastic bidet."}, {"id": "h9eqrl", "name": "Cheap pens", "n_comments": 2, "text": "The lowest-price option for pens, of course, is to bring home a box from work.

You're probably nuts, and I'm absolutely nuts.\n\nWhen I open up and tell someone something I've been through, describe my honest feelings about something personal, the likely response is, \"You should see a therapist.\" Maybe that's why I don't often open up and describe my honest feelings, but today I'll open up:\n\n\u2666 I've had about three genuine friends in my life, and two of them are dead.\n\n\u2666 I talk to myself, a lot, sometimes saying very cruel things \u2014 about you, though, not about me.\n\n\u2666 I eat too much, probably because I'm trying to fill an emotional emptiness inside.\n\n\u2666 I'd rather be alone than in almost any social situation you could imagine.\n\n\u2666 I kinda like disco music.\n\nThat's just the beginning of my nuttiness, of course; the list goes on and on. Stifle any advice, though. I've embraced my inner nut, and I'm doing OK. \n\nAnd I'm not the only nut. We are legion. Any time anyone opens up about what *they're* going through or describes *their* honest feelings, it's clear to me that they're cashews and almonds:\n\n\u2666 \"I purge after every meal.\"\n\n\u2666 \"I haven't had a good night's sleep in years.\"\n\n\u2666 \"Most days I break down and cry, and I'm not sure why.\"\n\n\u2666 \"I count to 1,000 when I'm washing my hands.\"\n\n\u2666 \"I actually like my job.\"\n\n\u2026 and more and more, all direct quotes from people I've known \u2014 and liked, and still like \u2014 but people who are nuts. Everyone I respect is nuts, at least a little, maybe a lot. Also, everyone I despise.\n\nIs there anyone on Earth who's *not* insane or going there? Anyone? Bueller? Is my perspective skewed because I'm nuts, so I tend to notice the other nuts? Are you one of the nuts, like me and everyone I know? Or am I just nuts?\n\nAnd what about those lucky few people who apparently have no issues, those friggin' bastards who seem to be comfortable, composed, and at ease in any situation? If we got to know any of those not-nuts a little better, you know they'd reveal themselves as nuts, too.\n\nSomeone who\u2019s limping, or someone who\u2019s massively overweight, you can see their situation at a glance. We can't see other people's mental or psychological injuries, though, so there's a tendency to assume they're doing just fine. In truth, of course, all of us walk with a limp.\n\nAll of us are nuts, but it's obvious that some people are nuttier than others. Someone who mutters about lizards ruling the universe is nuttier than me or maybe you, and should have access to either help or institutionalization. Someone who endorses simpleminded hoaxes and rejects plain facts shouldn't be President of the United States, with quick access to the nuclear launch codes.\n\nThe root of the problem, I believe, is that most people can't or won't acknowledge that they're nuts. Tell them they're nuts and they'll argue. Me, I don't argue, I agree. Sure, I'm nuts and so are you. Why not say it out loud?\n\nYeah, I'm serious about this. Self-improvement and world-improvement both begin by accepting that nuttiness is universal, and within all of us. The problem can't be addressed if it can't be acknowledged, so don't deny it, confess it. *Shout it!* You might learn to live with your nuttiness (that's my choice), or you might try to reduce your nuttiness (and I'm rooting for you), but it's nuts to pretend you're not nuts.

Would the train's electrical system interfere with radio reception, if I brought a radio?\n\nThanks."}, {"id": "bd8axm", "name": "I enjoyed the heck out of series 11. A lot of people didn't, but I don't understand why. So \u2014 why?", "n_comments": 116, "text": "May I respectfully question the people who have complained about series 11? Honestly, I don't see the problem. The Doctor has regenerated, and the showrunner has changed, but to this long-time fan, what made it to the screen in series 11 was very much *Doctor Who*, and was quite good *Doctor Who*.\n\nIt's my hope that the complaints about series 11 don't boil down to \"The Doctor can't be a woman,\" but that's by far the biggest change I can see between series 11 and everything else in *Modern Who*. Other than that and some new faces behind and in front of the camera, what's changed?\nHere's my answer to that question, but I'd like to see yours.\n\nThe stories in series 11 were often smaller in scale than they've been for the past few years, affecting a few people or a family instead of imperiling the entire known universe and the very fabric of time and space. Mr Moffatt tended toward stories told on that much larger canvas, and for me it grew tiresome. There's a limited number of times the Doctor can save the universe, before saving the universe becomes rather ho-hum.\n\nThe writing in series 11 was (in my opinion) often excellent, but sometimes fell short. Mr Chibnall is, I think, not as good a writer as Davies or Moffatt. For series 11, Chibnall did a lot of the writing, and in several episodes everything tended to be resolved a bit too quick-and-easy during the last few minutes. Still, this strikes me as a minor complaint, since I don't demand that every episode must be perfect. My standards only require \"pretty good,\" and at that bar, every episode in series 11 delivered.\n\nI prefer that when characters die, they remain dead. Grace was killed in series 11's first episode, and she later came back, but only as a ruse. During the Moffat and Davies eras numerous characters were killed, sometimes more than once, only to really and truly (albeit fictionally, of course) come back. The Doctor, The Master, and Jack Harkness are always resurrecting, but we also saw the ultimate comeback from (alphabetically) Ashildr/Me, Astrid Peth, Lady Cassandra, Clara, Miss Evangelista, both Jennies (Jenny No-Name in The Doctor's Daughter, and Jenny Flint in The Name of the Doctor), Osgood, Rassilon the Time Lord, River Song, Rory, Rose, Rose's father, and probably others I've forgotten. Like saving the universe, there's a low limit to the number of fictional characters who can come back from the dead, before being dead no longer carries much weight.\n\nSometimes in series 11, there wasn't much for all four recurring characters to do, and it felt like only two or three of the four were needed to resolve the week's menace. Four is a large number to handle well in 45 minutes, but Mr Chibnall has chosen the number 4, so the blame falls to him. Again, though, that's a quibble more than a complaint.\n\nI'm constantly cycling through classic and modern episodes, watching 2-4 stories or episodes most weeks, and to me there's little noticeable difference between our present Doctor and any of her previous *Modern Who* incarnations. The Doctor has changed, but not much more than when 9 morphed into 10. The vibe is the same. If there's a difference in storytelling, it's not a big difference, and it's more in style than in quality. To my watcher's eye, there's no episode in series 11 that would be disappointing or out of place at any other point in *Modern Who*. The transition was seamless, if you ask me.\n\nSince I'm rewatching series 4\u00bd this week \u2014 David Tenant's \"special\" episodes between series 4 and series 5 \u2014 I'll compare series 11 to these. There's plenty of fun and plenty to recommend in series 4\u00bd, and I've watched these episodes several times. But there's no continuing companion to care about, and there's more than the usual amount of silliness, dropped plot points, and characters who do things solely to advance or imperil the plot, not for any reason that makes internal sense. In \"Planet of the Dead,\" for example, why does Captain Magambo order Malcolm to close the wormhole before the Doctor is out, and why is this forgotten/forgiven after the Doctor escapes? Why does the Doctor help Christina escape punishment for her many crimes \u2014 in a flying bus? She was, after all, a major thief; now she's a thief in a flying bus. These and other things really don't make sense, even within the highly flexible universe of *Doctor Who*. \n\nI didn't find any such gaping plot points in series 11. With only the briefest exceptions, pretty much everyone in every episode seems to behave in a manner consistent with his/her motivations. Or explain how I'm mistaken, please, if I am.\n\nToward the end of series 4\u00bd's \"The Waters of Mars,\" the Doctor decides that as the last of his kind, he is \"the Time Lord Victorious\" \u2014 so he violates the show's well-established rules, and saves Captain Brooke despite her death being a fixed point in time. It makes for good drama, but I prefer to think that by age 906 the Doctor has decided his moral values and he's not still figuring out who he is. It left the Doctor acting as a borderline God, and that's always troubled me.\n\nI don't see any moments like that in series 11. The Doctor is true to her character from beginning to end and at all points along the way. She knows the difference between right and wrong, and she chooses to do right. That's the Doctor. Again, if I'm mistaken and she's somehow out of character, please explain.\n\nSeries 4\u00bd ends with a two-parter, \"The End of Time,\" which I've watched several times and never quite understood. Despite watching it again just yesterday, if you asked me to summarize the story I'd be flummoxed, as the focus changes so many times along the way. The Master flies through the air like a superhero, shoots bolts of lightning as weapons from his hands, and becomes everyone on Earth except Donna Noble. We're told several times that Donna's mind will burn up and she'll die if she remembers that she was the Doctor's companion, and she does remember, but it apparently only causes headaches, and when she forgets again she's fine. The Gallifreyan Council returns, and then Gallifrey itself returns, and we meet another Time Lord who's arguably even more insane than The Master. Meanwhile, a couple of cacti come to the rescue, and the Doctor somehow fixes and hijacks the cacti's derelict spaceship, before dying and regenerating into Matt Smith. It's all watchable and kind of fun, because *Doctor Who* is almost always watchable and fun, and it's impossible not to cry at the end, but honestly, the storytelling in these episodes is a confused mess.\n\nThere's no episode in series 11 that I'd describe as confused or a mess. Every story makes sense, and none are so needlessly complex that you'd need a flow chart to grok what the heck happened to whom and why. Or, if I'm wrong, please explain which plot elements left you perplexed or disappointed.\n\nTL/DR: I enjoyed the heck out of series 11. A lot of people didn't, but I don't understand why.

Rub it into your hair for a few seconds, for enough soapy suds to 'shampoo' without the expense of shampoo.\n\nShampoo belongs in the same category as conditioner, mousse, and everything on the rack at a beauty salon \u2014 it's something some people might need, especially if they have delicate or fragile hair. But for most people who have hair, it's not a necessity, and maybe it's not worth the price.\n\nSome people use shampoo because it leaves a scent, and I can't argue with that. When I was much, much younger I remember noticing a pleasant aroma from the hair of a few ladies of my acquaintance. So I shampoo with a bar of soap that's peppermint-scented, and my hair smells a little pepperminty all day long.\n\nMaybe shampooing adds a sheen you can't get with Dial or Dove? I've never noticed that sheen, and never wanted it, but then again, writing these few paragraphs is the most time I've ever spent thinking about hair.\n\nShampoo fell off my shopping list in the mid-1980s, so I've gone 35+ years without it. Probably this is just a coincidence, but my father, uncle, and brothers all had serious male pattern baldness by their 40s, and I'm way past that age but my hairline has just barely begun receding.

I built Odin to change the way in which one can run and manage scheduled jobs, and now I'm looking for help to manifest it's potential!\n \nYou can check out the project [here](https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin). More info about the project can be found below!\n\nI've set up [this Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gFr2Yq) to concentrate the development process as we get closer to v2.0.0! If you are interested in helping out in anyway feel free to join!\n\nThe primary objective of such a system is to provide users/teams a  shared platform for jobs that allows individual members to package their  code for periodic execution, providing a set of metrics and variable  insights which will in turn lend transparency and understanding into the  execution of all system run jobs. Odin aims to do this by changing the  way in which we approach scheduling and managing jobs.\n\nJob schedulers by definition are supposed to eliminate toil, a kind  of work tied to running a service which is manual, repetitive and most  importantly - automatable. Classically, job schedulers are ad-hoc  systems that treat it\u2019s jobs as code to be executed, specifying the  parameters of what is to be executed, and when it is to be executed.  This presents a problem for those implementing the best practices of  DevOps. DevOps is something to be practiced in the tools a team uses,  and when traditional job schedulers fail they introduce a new level of  toil in debugging what went wrong.\n\nOdin treats it\u2019s jobs as code to be managed before and after  execution. While caring about what is to be executed and when it will be  executed, Odin is equally concerned with the expected behavior of your  job, which is to be described entirely by the user\u2019s code. This  observability can be achieved through a web facing user interface which  displays job logs and metrics. All of this will be gathered through the  use of Odin libraries (written in Go, Python, Bash and Node.js) and will help  infer the internal state of jobs. For teams, this means Odin can  directly help diagnose where the problems are and get to the root cause  of any interruptions. Debugging, but faster!\n\nAgain, if there's any interest in helping out or you have any suggestions please feel free to comment!

It was originally developed as a final year project for university but it turned out to be pretty useful. When we started development on this, we had 0 knowledge of golang and have learned a tonne since we started.\n\nBelow is a description but you can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/GhostDB/GhostDB):\n\nGhostDB is a distributed, in-memory, general purpose key-value data store that delivers microsecond performance at any scale.\n\nGhostDB provides a very large hash table that is distributed across multiple machines and stores large numbers of key-value pairs within the hash table. However, it's more than just a big hash table. GhostDB has multiple levels of on-disk persistence in the form of point-in-time snapshots and an append-only-file used to restore a cache node if it crashes, concurrent crawlers that will automatically evict stale data, fine grained metrics, and if configured correctly, can serve 200k+ requests per second from more than 1.5M concurrent keep-alive connections per physical server.\n\nUsers of GhostDB can configure GhostDB nodes on machines they have control over. The clients application servers will be capable of interacting with GhostDB through the GhostDB SDKs much the same way their application servers may interface with a MySQL or MongoDB instance.\n\nOur SDKs are available for Python and Node.js (Java and Golang SDKs in development) and are simple to use. With just 4 lines of extra code in your application servers, you are able to achieve up to a 25x increase in data retrieval speeds when compared to databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.\n\nWe have a vision for GhostDB and have spent some time refactoring it before releasing it as open source in order to facilitate extending it further.\n\nIn the future we plan to add: direct support for queues and other data structures, transactional read/write operations and a whole bunch more.\n\nWe would love to hear feedback and if it's something you're interested in, we would love you to contribute - we're beginner friendly!\n\nCheck out the repo here:  [https://github.com/GhostDB/GhostDB](https://github.com/GhostDB/GhostDB)"}, {"id": "hm91pj", "name": "Docker Image with Go2 from dev.go2go branch", "n_comments": 3, "text": "Hi guys.\n\nIt so happened that I found it convenient to use Docker to compile code in different languages.

I have tried to fix it by stretching before, but whatever routine I found (like Starting Stretching which is recommended in the wiki) contained one or more stretches which I was unable to do because my shoulders (particularly the right) were too tight. A week ago I stumbled upon DeFranco's Simple Six and decided to give it a shot. It seems like I can to all the required movements (maybe not, see question below) but I have a couple questions to two of them which I couldn't find an answer for.\n\nSleeper stretch: How should my shoulder be positioned when doing this? If I try to mimic DeFranco's video, and let my scapula follow my arm, as is natural for me, I can easily lay my palm flat on the floor without any stretching. If I try to keep my scapula in line with my back, which I guess is it's neutral position, I am having a hard time even getting into the starting position. That is because my scapula \"wants\" to rotate forward/inward.\n\nUpper back foam rolling: I try to separate my scapulas as much as possible, as instructed, but when I do that I just end up foam rolling my spine. Is that intended? I thought foam rolling was for muscles.\n\nEDIT: a lot of general tips for rounded shoulders here. Thanks, but I've read extensively about it and I do have a fair amount of pulling movements in my program. Researching rounded shoulders is what made me decide to stretch. Helpful tips are always welcome, but I am more interested in answers to the questions I asked."}, {"id": "hojgo8", "name": "Max isometric pull Vs deficit deadlift for floor sticking point", "n_comments": 11, "text": "If someone has a below the knee sticking point for the deadlift, why are deficit deadlifts advocated for?

Super skinny to muscular - 1 year 6 months of progress including insightful story", "n_comments": 225, "text": "**Background:**\n\nThe day was Wednesday 2nd January 2019 - I purchased my first ever gym  membership and attended the gym for the first time in my entire life,  walking into this unknown with zero knowledge. Prior to this, I had been suffering from severe depression throughout my entire life for multiple  reasons such as being bullied, being skinny, experiencing racism and  all the rest of the insults that I had received. This almost lead me to  try and commit suicide because I just thought life wasn't worth living,  so basically the gym/nutrition has give me hope in my life. I had no  ambition or drive in my life to want to become a better version of  myself, but I won't bog you down too much with that as you're not here  for that, right?\n\nI work a full-time job for 40 hours per week, so I was always that person who  thought I never had time for the gym because I worked a full-time job. I  was infact mistaken, I just had to find the determination and  dedication to put into the gym to make it work out for me, I had to find  ways and solutions to be able to eat all the food I eat whilst working,  and also attending the gym and getting a good nights sleep.\n\nI  decided that it was time to change everything, it was time to change  how I viewed the world, how I viewed myself as a person and how I viewed  my life. I wanted to make something of myself and I wanted to be the  reason that many more people that are/have been in the same situation as  me can also change themselves for the better and improve little tiny  things in their lifestyles - I will be making my Instagram account  dedicated to fitness, healthy nutrition, exercises and overall having a  healthy lifestyle and keeping away from depression.\n\n**My Journey:**\n\nWeighing  in at a staggering VERY unhealthy weight of 49kg (108 lbs). To put this  into perspective, my BMI calculation was at the very end of the red  zone, suggesting I was very underweight and baring in mind I don't have  any eating disorders. The healthy weight for someone of my height  started from 56.7kg (125 lbs).\n\nI  walked into the gym having absolutely zero exercise, nutrition or gym  knowledge. I didn't have any friends who went to the gym, I didn't have  any family who I knew went to the gym so all I had was myself and the  internet. A personal trainer was out of the question to get me started  because I couldn't afford it. I remember it was also a very intimidating  experience for me as there was a lot of fairly muscular people working  out, and it always felt like everyone was watching me, the usual gym  beginners problems - of course no one was watching me, they were in the  gym for the same reason as myself.\n\nAfter  my first ever workout, I had DOMs for at least 5 days afterwards and  that put me off going back. Another thing that put me off was the amount  of eating I was doing (the only knowledge I had was to eat as much as  possible), I went from eating a packet of Doritos for my 8pm tea to  eating about 2500 calories. The diet seemed much harder than going the  actual gym itself because I wasn't use to eating so much food. I would  probably eat 2500 calories spread out across 2-3 days before I went to  the gym.\n\nFast forward to attending  the gym for a whole month, and I started to see that the scales where  going up, so whatever I was doing was working. This was when I was  becoming serious about the gym and from that month onwards, I always set  myself targets to reach for all my exercises.\n\nFast  forward 2-3 months into my journey and it was a weird feeling, I  started to become more comfortable in my own skin. I started to not care  what people thought about me out in public or inside the gym. One major  problem for me was my ego, I wanted to make it seem like I was lifting  heavy weight for people to see rather than for my own personal benefit,  which sacrificed my form on a lot of my exercises, but I eventually  overcome this problem after 6 months of my journey.\n\nMy  breakfast included the likes of sausages, egg, bacon, tomatoes and  beans (I can't remember the exact macros as I never use to track my  food). For my lunch, I would eat a massive bowl(I mean massive, to the  point I kept gagging because I was so full) of egg fried rice. For my  tea (dinner, whatever you refer to it as) I would eat cooked chicken  thighs and I ate a lot of them, approx 800-1000 calories worth. For  snacks throughout the day, I would prepare sandwiches with ham and  turkey slices to eat. I also bought USN Anabolic Mass weight gainer  about 3-4 months in and had 1 shake per day. I was eating approx. 2500  calores. I use to prepare my food the day before so I was able to eat  them in work and then go to the gym in the evening.\n\n6  months in, I started learning so much more about the gym, exercises and  nutrition from all the time I put into researching. I changed my  breakfast from a full English to Lasagne (I'm not kidding about this, I  ate Lasagne for breakfast for at least another 7 months). Although  Lasagne isn't that healthy, I found it was much better than eating  sausage and bacon every day. About 1 month into eating Lasagne, I  changed the beef mince to 2% fat turkey mince because that was  healthier, so the only unhealthy thing about it at this point was the  industrialised cream sauce and fatty cheese. For my snack, I use to eat a  little salad box including Kiwifruit. Lunch, I had 200g (dry) pasta  with Dolmio sauce. For another snack, I had 2 x pizza subs (not the  healthiest). For my tea I had chicken thighs still.\n\n*Breakfast: 816.15 cal*\n\n*Lunch: 1149 cal*\n\n*Dinner: 855 cal*\n\n*Shake: 564 cal*\n\n*Total Calories: 3384.15*\n\n*Protein: 267g*\n\nThe  exercise I have struggled most with has definitely been bench press. My  ectomorph bodytype and long arms don't help in this exercise so it has  definitely been a struggled to get it where it is today. I'm really  striving for that 2 plate bench press though by the end of this year, at  least.\n\nUnfortunately I injured my  right bicep after a few months of training and that meant I couldn't do  arm workouts for approx. 6 months. I used the easy curl bar and sat  down on the bench/stool provided. I must of been squeezing my hands too  hard for my grip, whilst trying to straighten my arm out as much as  possible with a heavy weight. I must of trapped something or tear  something, but it took months to heal. I only just started training my  arms towards the beginning of this year so I feel as if they're very  underdeveloped at the moment. I also injuried my right knee area from  doing deadlifts a few months in, I've put that down to the fact I wasn't  very good with squats so my knee joint was very weak. It seemed to  subside after a few weeks, but it's still comes back occasionally so I'm  just careful with my weight.\n\nI  changed my diet up coming up to my 1 year gym anniversary.

Documentary Research/Participation", "n_comments": 2, "text": "Hey,  \n\nI'm a filmmaker currently in the research and development stages of a documentary which seeks to explore the relationship between video games and positive mental health.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic and the local lockdown measures I have found myself increasingly turning to gaming as a way of dealing with the stress brought on by the situation. On introspection and reflection, it has become apparent how often in life I have turned to gaming in moments of high emotional turmoil. On discussing this with other gamers and conducting preliminary research into the available academic material it is something I feel should be investigated further.\n\nTo that end I am making the documentary. Some of the people I currently have involved are.\n\n\\- A professor in the field of Game Studies who has conducted extensive research on this subject.\n\n\\- A clinical child psychologist and researcher with \u201cGaming the Mind\u201d a group which looks at mental health advocacy in gaming.\n\n\\- An award-winning game journalist and mental health advocate within gaming.\n\nI am also in discussions with several game studios and agents for some of the biggest streamers. My hope is that this broad analysis of the industry and the positive mental health impacts it has can raise awareness for something that we as gamers already know. Games are not only good but can be good for you.\n\nSo much of the mainstream media has been historically critical of games and gamers. Be that the stereotyped basement goblin to the idea that video game violence is the cause of school shootings. We have read the literature; we know it's bullshit. But it's time to do more than just defend, it's time to attack. To go on the offensive and show non gamers that games actually make us better humans.\n\nCovid 19 has offered me this opportunity, for the first time, mainstream media are talking fervently about the benefits of gaming, how it can help you through lockdown. For me, this is merely a starting point to talk about the overreaching benefits of gaming.\n\nWhere do you come in? I want to hear your stories about when video games helped you deal with any mental health issue. These personal stories are what will contextualise the academic research. It will allow an audience to connect with real people and real stories. If you are comfortable sharing, then share away, even if this is just a forum to open this sort of discussion that\u2019s enough.\n\nIf you would consider being featured in the documentary, however, please feel free to send me a message and I will get back to you asap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR \u2013 I\u2019m making a doc about gaming and positive mental health. Tell me your stories about how gaming helped you through mental health issues, message me if you would like to be featured in the doc."}, {"id": "hpz60r", "name": "Piggy Axl Foley Remix", "n_comments": 0, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpz54b", "name": "Um...

THIS POST IS HELLA LONG**\n\nMy uncle had a SNES when I was younger, I remember the times when I was 4-5, I got to play on it when we visited him. It's probably a big reason why I love video games so much.\n\nThis was in Sweden 2008-2009, so an SNES wasn't really something people knew much about. For my sixth birthday, my uncle decided that he didn't have any use of it, so he cleaned it up, put it back in to the box it came in, wraped it up and gave it to me as a present. Along with A Link to the Past and Super Mario world, the two games I loved to play then.\n\nI was in love with that SNES, every day after school I came home and rushed to my room to play. I didn't like playing things like football, so I didn't really have any friends. Even though I had bought a computer to play on the a couple months later, I still used the SNES a lot.\n\nMy mom hated the fact that I didn't play any sports and that I sat inside almost all the time. So she decided to force me to do something other than playing video games. On march 5th 2010 she took my SNES, drove to a Second Hand and gave it away. When I got home from school I was devastated, something that meant so much to me was just taken away. She saw how I reacted and remembered that it was a gift from my uncle, so she took me to the Second Hand the morning after to try and get it back. \n\nBut when we got there the staff member mom gave it to explained that someone came in a bought it just a couple hours after they put it on the shelves. I didn't cry this time though, I just sat silent all the way home. My mom was apologized almost every day for weeks.\nI still had my pc, and did play on it. But it didn't feel the same, so I just stopped playing video games.\n\nAfter a lot of thinking I wanted to try picking up a sport, since everyone else in my class played Football, Hockey, etc.\nSo I tried football and I disliked it a lot, then I tried something my Grandpa and Dad played a lot when they were younger, Badminton.\nI played it for a little less than a year, until a new kid came to our class, she also played badminton, and I knew that because we played in the same hall. But I didn't KNOW her.\n\nI started to talk with her every now and then, and she was really fun to hang out with, we went to practice together and talked a lot about our interests, she mentioned that she really enjoyed playing Minecraft. I knew what Minecraft was at that time, I kept up with some news on YouTube every now and then.\n\nI wasn't really interested in video games anymore, but when she invited me over to play some with her I didn't want say no. And something sparked inside me when she told me to try it. My once burning passion for video games had gotten so small, but there was still something there. When I got home I searched up some videos of Minecraft, and I really really enjoyed the concept of the game. So the following week I talked to my friend in school about Minecraft, and I told her that I really wanted to buy it.\n\nOne of our classmates overheard our conversation and to my surprise, he also played Minecraft, then he called over his friends, who also played it.\n\nSuddenly, I wasn't the odd one in class, there were others like me. That same day when I came home I told my mom and dad about what me and my friend did when I hung out with her, and that I wanted to pick up video games again, starting with Minecraft. They were really supportive, and since my sister had gotten a lot of things during the past year, my parents wanted things to be fair. So my dad took me out to get a new PC, and once it was set up they bought Minecraft for me. \n\nIt was almost time for summer break to begin, and by that time I had gotten sort of good at playing Minecraft.  I played with my new friends almost every day, and I can't remember a time when I was happier.\n\nOver the years I tried hard to earn more money, I applied for summer jobs for younger people, I helped out in at the ranch that my sister went to for her horse riding. Which I got paid for. After about a year I got myself a used PS3 with about 15 games, two years after that I got myself an XBOX ONE, with Titanfall and a bunch of other games. My friend worked hard to so she could play with me.\n\nWe played and hung out a lot for almost 4 years. Until my friend told the class one day in 5th grade that she was gonna move to Stockholm, I remember feeling the same weight in my stomach the time mom took my SNES. But I supported her because she was my friend, and I only wanted he to be happy, even if that meant we couldn't see each other anymore.\n(Her dad lives in Stockholm and she wanted to spend more time with him after 8 years with her mom, they had already sent a moving company with her stuff)\n\nI was told the date she was leaving by train. So I went to the train station that day hoping she hadn't left yet, luckily he train didn't arrive for another 20 minutes. So I got to say goodbye to her before she left. I was actually happy that I got to say goodbye, and I continued to play badminton.\n\nBut the fact that she was gone when 6th grade started was enough for me to lose most motivation to play video games. And started to focus more and more on training and studying. \n\nIn 7th grade our classes are separated to make new classes with kids from other schools that get transfered to our school(Our school is one of the 3 schools that go all the way to 9th grade, the other schools nearby only go to 6th grade).\nWe get our new classes, and I know some people, but no one that enjoys Badminton, or drawing, which I tried and really enjoyed. (I got really good at it and started with digital art)\n\nIn 8th grade for Student's Choice, I picked Cambridge classes to get a certificate, it can help a lot when looking for High schools and further education.\nIn this class I met some people I knew from my previous class, and some new people.\nThis one person who hung out some times with my previous classmates, was told that I used to enjoy video games a lot. So we started talking on Snapchat, and we really clicked in a way.\n\nA couple weeks after we started to talk she asked me if I had an Xbox, I answered yes and asked what games she likes. \"Titanfall is a good one, even if it's old\", my heart lit up the same way it did many years ago. We agreed to play one day after school, so when I got home I picked up the controller again after 3 years, logged in to my Xbox account, and I noticed something, my old friend was online. I instantly pieced it all together and invited her to a party. She acted casual all the time so I did the same. \n\nWe kept playing games together, and it made me feel like I was 10 again. I kept acting like I knew it was her all the time. We still play video games together and we've gotten even closer since then.\n\nYesterday I was going through my old stuff, and I found the boxes for A Link to Past and Super Mario World (Credit to my mom for not giving away the games with a game console, which requires games to function correctly.). I was reminded of the fun I had at my uncle's house, and the joy it brought me. Then I started to think about how that one event, me getting a SNES. Started an 10 year long chain of events which gave me experiences I never thought I would get.\n\nToday me and my friend went down to town to hang out, I told her about this whole story. She asked me why I was telling her all of this.\nI said \"Because if a single one of the events that took place before I met her went differently, I wouldn't be able to ask this.\"\nI then asked her out on a date, she said yes.\n\nNow I have a date with my best friend in 4 days, and to be honest, I regret nothing in my life. Not a single day.\nWish me luck for my date!"}, {"id": "hpxmct", "name": "Lifeline bug is making her D.O.C drone unusable, Apex legends", "n_comments": 0, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpofak", "name": "Can boomer shooters run well on a cheap non gaming laptop?", "n_comments": 4, "text": "I don't know what non gaming laptop i'm buying yet but it will be $400 or under.

It\u2019s come to my attention, however, that this particular game is one of those obscure gems with a small player base, a game most gamers likely aren\u2019t aware of. I wasn\u2019t aware of it for a long time myself even after getting into social deduction games a couple years back. Now, I\u2019d like to describe what brought me to like this game more than any other game on the market currently.\n\nTo be honest, I would rather play certain kinds of games that don\u2019t exist yet, but for the time being, I happen to like this game over the usual alternatives in the gaming world. I don\u2019t like single-player games generally and I don\u2019t like most shooters anymore. Probably the only shooter I\u2019d enjoy at this point is BioShock 2 multiplayer, but that\u2019s apparently a dead game on PC and I don\u2019t have a console. Other than that, shooters mostly reduce to point-and-shoot, with very little element of deduction, deception, manipulation, or neutrality involved. In shooters, everyone\u2019s running around blasting each other and gearing and re-gearing and it tends to be virtually the same experience over and over again. It\u2019s basically pure violence without character. That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re into that, but I find I enjoy a conversational game of deception more than what could be considered the mainstream shooter scene.\n\nHaving said that, I\u2019ll get into what Throne of Lies is about and why it\u2019s become my favorite game. A lot of you are probably aware of a game called Town of Salem. This is one of the most popular social deduction games in existence, and it was my first introduction to hidden role games. For a while, about two years, I liked ToS, mainly its chaos modes rather than ranked. I liked the chaotic and randomized nature of towns and roles and the existence of evil and neutral roles. I even liked it more than WoW in some ways, which is a game I\u2019d played since I was an adolescent. Then the Unity update was released, and I, like many other players, didn\u2019t like the drastic UI changes. I also began to find the game is too simple, having almost no day abilities and only one night ability max per role. That, as well as the repetitive ambiance and the lack of separate night rooms made me start to view the game as a little dry.\n\nI got into this little FTP game called MINDNIGHT for a while, which some of you may also be aware of. I like that game\u2019s retrofuturistic style and ambiance, but eventually I also found it overly simplified, as it\u2019s only ever agents vs hackers with no neutral roles. As I no longer play shooters or WoW and as ToS and MINDNIGHT began to feel too basic to me, I decided to get back into Throne of Lies a bit, which I hadn\u2019t played since last Halloween.\n\nFor gamers who aren\u2019t into or familiar with social deduction games, a game like Throne of Lies can seem kind of absurd and slow. You\u2019re not sprinting around shooting random people left and right. You\u2019re a member of a faction in a castle court with multiple factions and neutrals present, some of whom want each other dead. This kind of game offers, to me, a richer and more nuanced gaming experience than most games today do, even if ToL has its flaws like any other game. What I like the most about it is the prominence of deduction, deception, manipulation, and neutrality, as I mentioned. As basically any role, you can deceive and manipulate others into making mistakes and doing your bidding. You can work with neutrals, and as a neutral, you can mostly choose any side you want. It\u2019s a game that requires, in my opinion, a relatively advanced skill level to master well. I don\u2019t think I myself have mastered it well enough yet, as there are so many classes, class lists, and possible strategies that it can take some time to reach a point where you intuit the GTO quickly and act on it. There tends to be so much information, trickery, and chaos present it can be difficult to determine who\u2019s good, who\u2019s neutral, who\u2019s evil, and what the best course of action during the day and the night is. All of these factors and others lead me to consider this game one of the most complicated social deduction games on the market.\n\nThat\u2019s a basic explanation of why I like the game more than most others. If you\u2019re interested in a more detailed description, and especially if you\u2019re new to this game or this genre, feel free to continue reading and I\u2019ll delve a bit into specifics of this game that distinguish it from others, and in particular, other social deduction games.\n\nThere are four main factions present in the court. Blue Dragon is considered the good faction and is always present. The main evil factions are the Unseen and the Cult, and only one of those factions is ever present. Unseen/Cult can convert Blue Dragon members, so even if someone is confirmed BD, they may be turned. Aside from the Blue Dragon and the Unseen/Cult, multiple neutrals are always in the court, including 2-3 non-killer neutrals and a neutral killer. As in ToS, a trifecta conflict exists between the good faction, the evil faction, and the neutral killer, who are all mutual enemies but who can also mutually benefit each other in certain circumstances. It\u2019s not as simple as one faction versus another faction. There are three main factions, and the existence of neutrals further complicates the faction disputes and allows for people to take sides.\n\nTo make matters more complex, the king is not always good. The king can be evil and aligned to either the Unseen or the Cult, but will often pretend to be Blue Dragon in order to avoid being accused and executed by the court. If the original king dies, a new king can also be elected, who may be good, evil, or neutral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of the facets of ToL I like more than a game like ToS are:\n\n\u00b7 There is no medium. The dead cannot communicate to the living.\n\n\u00b7 There is no retributionist. The dead cannot be revived, so death is hardcore.\n\n\u00b7 Neutrals have more nuanced objectives and take more skill to win as.\n\n\u00b7 NK requires more calculation and features a broader skill set than simple murder.\n\n\u00b7 NK can, to some degree, take control of the court solo in late game. Possessor and reaper in particular have abilities that allow them to prevent others from voting against them. If neutrals side with the NK, this makes NK especially dangerous in late game.\n\n\u00b7 It is not immediately clear whether the Unseen or the Cult are present.\n\n\u00b7 It is not immediately clear what the neutral killer is. This requires the court to determine what the NK is and how to proceed based on the information.\n\n\u00b7 It is not clearly stated how people die, unlike in games like ToS, where the town is told exactly what killed a player.\n\n\u00b7 There are multiple abilities that allow evils in particular to manipulate the court and cause chaos.\n\n\u00b7 The night rooms and their unique scores provide a cozy little aesthetic that differs markedly from the empty town and repetitive music of ToS.\n\n\u00b7 Blue Dragon is, in my analysis, a relatively more even faction vs evil as compared to Town vs evil in ToS. Conversions make it difficult for BD to determine fellow BD, even when a BD becomes confirmed.\n\n\u00b7 The king is not always good and there is an interesting dynamic around discerning whether the king is evil and how to proceed based on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a criticism of the game, I don\u2019t like most of the character models, I think the chat text could use some improvement, and the game can be a bit janky sometimes, as well as the queues being somewhat slow at times. I also think the game could use a ranked mode and a chaos mode. These are all to be expected from an obscure game on sale for $2. The devs need better resources and they should improve the game more over time. The main reason I write this post is not only to describe my own tastes, but to ask gamers to consider playing this game and trying something new. It has a small community currently and we could use more players. Once you get a feel for the classes and faction dynamics, it becomes interesting to challenge yourself to win games and experiment using different strategies. Myself, one of the most enjoyable aspects of a game like this is that, as evil/neutral, you can often stay quiet and keep a low profile as people accuse each other and gloss over you. This can allow you to bide your time and rid the court of enemies as you grow closer to parity/majority and try to work with neutrals or others to take control. It\u2019s not a game for everyone, but for people who like social deduction, and especially for people who like chaos, deceit, and randomization, ToL, like many other games, allows for infinite novelty, even if it\u2019s also a bit underdeveloped and wonky.\n\n\\- DLX"}, {"id": "hpigzs", "name": "Giving away an Origin code for FIFA 19!", "n_comments": 2, "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI won this code as a prize in an event but I don't really play FIFA, so I figured I'd just give it away to someone who needs it.\n\nI'd love for this to go to an actual player instead of a reseller (not like it's worth all that much, anyway).\n\nTo enter, just let me know who your favourite soccer player is!\n\nI'll randomly choose a winner at 9pm EST and contact them to let them know what the code is.\n\nEdit: Winner has been contacted!"}, {"id": "hphxvr", "name": "Opening up some games and accessories I picked up in a package from Japan.

I started with Commodore 64, then went to Amiga, then Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, PS, PS 2, PS 3, GameCube, Wii, Wii U. I also had an Xbox 360 and plenty of handheld consoles. Then I stopped.

I would play with it on TV only. \n\nOn the other side I have been intrigued by the PS4 and titles such as The Last of Us, Grand Turismo, Spider-Man, but wondered whether I would they would be too time intensive, too much on the serious note with no fun stuff like the Nintendo games.\n\nAnd then Xbox, which I wonder whether at this point is an alternative I should consider. \n\nOn top of everything, the incredible difficulty to find these systems right now.

This is also commonly known as an [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem). \n\nExamples of this include, but are not limited to:\n \n * Name calling/insults\n * Comments directed at tertiary or \"meta\" reddit activity, including accusations of trolling or participating in bad faith\n * Purposefully demeaning comments\n * Ridiculing arguments while implicitly attacking a user\n * \"Sarcastic\" insults, i.e. \"You're cute\" or \"How adorable\"\n\nAlso note that we do not allow incivilty towards AMA guests. You can see the full rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_ama-specific_rules).\n\nThese rules do _not_ apply to public figures or institutions. \n\n#A note on our \"Do not make threats or advocate violence\" rule\n\nHere is the full text of the rule:\n\n>Do not threaten, advocate for, celebrate, or express extreme indifference towards **any** kind of action that results in or could result in death or harm (physical or otherwise). This rule applies to everyone. Users who engage in this behavior may be subject to a permanent subreddit ban.\n\nThis rule is strictly enforced and is zero tolerance. Wishing or hoping someone has physical harm, injury, or death  befall them in any capacity, no matter how minor, be it through illness (such as COVID-19, or cancer) or any other means, or celebrating/\"grave dancing\" any instances of harm **will not be tolerated**. Callous remarks about physical harm, or threatening/inciting violence **will not be tolerated**. It does not matter if your comment is a joke, it does not matter if you believe it is justified. \n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nIf you see comments of this nature, *please report them and do not respond in a way that breaks our rules*. The only way we can consistently enforce our rules is by addressing every report we come across the same way. In order to keep this community civil, we need all users to pitch in and help us to maintain this as a space for civil discussion. With subreddit activity ramping up to a large degree, it is more important now than ever for everyone to do their part, as there are vastly more users than there are mods, and we cannot be in every thread at every time.\n\nPlease try to report things accurately and avoid using the report feature as a \"super downvote\" button, as every time that happens it represents an actual rule-breaking comment or submission that our attention will be diverted from. \n\nFinally, we would like to thank the majority of users who consistently follow our rules, and whose example helps influence others to do the same. Additionally we would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to read this, and who make r/politics a part of their internet experience. We will continue doing our best to stem the tide of incivility moving forward, and we thank you for your effort in helping us with that mission."}, {"id": "hpv5ug", "name": "Japan is 'shocked' and furious at the US after a major coronavirus outbreak at 2 Marine bases in Okinawa \u2014 and says the US is not taking the virus seriously", "n_comments": 2655, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpwyni", "name": "Biden Slams Trump After President Is Seen Wearing Face Mask for First Time: He 'Wasted Four Months'", "n_comments": 356, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpufpc", "name": "Trump's New Hampshire rally was cancelled because of low attendance fears, advisers say", "n_comments": 784, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpv093", "name": "The Big Boy President Wore a Big Boy Mask And Now the Election is Over, Aides Say", "n_comments": 863, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpv9sv", "name": "Pelosi calls Trump public mask wearing 'an admission' that it can stop spread of coronavirus", "n_comments": 215, "text": ""}, {"id": "hptdze", "name": "Joe Biden builds lead over Donald Trump in reliably red Texas, as voters sour on handling of virus", "n_comments": 1141, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpz05j", "name": "Tom Hanks criticizes Trump response to coronavirus: 'I grew up looking to our leaders for calm and informed guidance'", "n_comments": 134, "text": ""}, {"id": "hpuwtm", "name": "Rep.

Attempts to contact an individual moderator via chat will be ignored.\n\nGreetings r/Paranormal friends. Due to consistent flagged reports, comment, and post violations, which result in removals and sometimes bans, we want to make a few things clear. Although any subreddit will recommend that you [read the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/wiki/index) before submitting content, not everyone knows where to find them (r/Paranormal's is found on our wiki), or wants to read them. It is important to review the rules of any subreddit before submitting content to avoid removals or bans. Below we've provided some common violations that we receive daily:\n\n# Common Violations\n\n**Cross-posting**: Do not cross-post content, which includes linking your r/Paranormal submission to another sub. r/Paranormal is only interested in original content, not content that can be found elsewhere.\n\n**Re-submitting content**: Do not re-submit content that was removed during moderation, which is also against [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com)'s content policy. If you re-submit content that was already removed, you will likely be banned.\n\n**Link Violations**: r/Paranormal only allows links to be submitted in both the comments and post from wikipedia, Youtube (limited content), Soundcloud, and Imgur. Links to any other website domain will be removed. Increased violations by the same user will likely result in a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n**Video Violations**: More times than not, users submit videos utilizing the wrong platform, full-length videos with suggested timestamps, or a video that does not belong to them (YouTube channel that focuses in paranormal content.).\n\n**Segmented Posts**: Do not submit segmented (part one,  part two) submissions. Each post provides the user the max allowance of characters. If extra space is needed, it is recommended that you use the comment section. You can reach out to the moderation team for assistance if needed.\n\n**Self-promotion**: r/Paranormal prohibits self-promotion of any kind. Do not promote your own business, youtube channel, podcast, asking to use content for your own purposes, etc. This includes promoting psychics to assist others or religious websites of any kind.\n\n**Name Calling**: There is no reason for users to get into verbal altercations within the comments. verbal disputes that result in foul language and name calling will likely result in a temporary or permanent ban. If there is an issue with other users, please flag the comment or post, and the moderation team will review it. This violation is covered by [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com)'s content policy.\n\n# Submitting Evidence\n\nIf you want to submit an image, EVP, or video evidence, it needs to be submitted via Imgur, Youtube, or Soundcloud, and then uploaded to the post. Try to avoid posting linked content in the comments, as it sometimes will get lost depending if the thread grows. See below for more information:\n\n* **Images** should be submitted on Imgur.\n* **EVPs** should be submitted to Soundcloud, although Imgur (if supported), and YouTube is also allowed. EVPs should be of ONLY the EVP segment and not an entire EVP clip.\n* **Videos** should be submitted on either YouTube or Imgur. Do not submit from monetized accounts or accounts that do not belong to you. Video evidence should be of ONLY the evidence you claimed to capture, not an entire clip. The video should be free of text, background music, and voiceovers. \n\nIf you have questions, feel free to [message the moderation team](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Paranormal)."}, {"id": "hpuu8k", "name": "Asked for a sign from my Grandma, was this one?", "n_comments": 12, "text": "My grandma passed away this year on my birthday, just as I'd had my first baby (thankfully she managed to stay long enough for him to be born and she could see a photo, but then she passed the day after) I'd been so busy and distracted with him that grieving has been unusual. So, yesterday I decided to ask her to show me a sign she's still around us, but needed something specific so I really knew it was her. I asked her to show me a \"Blue car, but make it obvious so I know it's you\".\n\nLater that day I went for a walk with my family in our city, the streets are largely closed off to cars at the moment with COVID lockdown, so people can socially distance walking in the roads. I wandered thoughtlessly down random streets and my husband happened to say \"Wow, look at that car\", I'd forgotten about the sign I asked for and took a look. Then I remembered; Driving past us was a 1930's Navy Blue car slowly crossing our pathway.  Blue, and make it obvious so I know it's you? It's definitely not something you see every day, and I believe that was the sign I asked for."}, {"id": "hpjhsw", "name": "My whole family was killed-why are they still here?", "n_comments": 71, "text": "When I was a baby, 3 members of my immediate family were killed when our car was run off the road by a drunk driver who ended up fleeing the scene and was never caught. I was the only survivor thanks to my car seat.\n\nLiving in the woods as a kid, you always feel a bit more in tune with your surroundings and nature I think. I would notice small things like movement from the corner of my eye, but real paranormal activity started in my teens.\nI stayed in a room across the hall from a now empty room; one that we kept most of my family member\u2019s belongings. When I sat on my bed reading, I could see clearly into that room. \nOften times I could see a quick flash of some light dart across the room, it wasn\u2019t from the window, but seemed more like a traveling ball of light. This was before I knew what orbs even were. However, I never got the chance to see one head on, only ever from my peripheral vision.\n\nFast forward to several years of this, I become used to it, and am never fearful of it. One of my friends mentioned seeing something but I brushed it off, even though I had a feeling it was my family\u2019s spirits.\nI often wondered why they were still here, I grew up thinking that spirits only stayed when they had unfinished business, what was it?\n\nIt was my final days in this house, I was packing to go to University the next week. As I often did, I sat on my bed and read a book, and again saw a flash of light. Immediately after, I clearly felt a hand gripping my shoulder; not in a malicious way, but I felt a deep warmness from it, like getting a warm hug on a cold day. What shocked me was that I was not startled by this, I felt at ease. The sensation quickly subsided and I sat there feeling all my previous nervousness of moving fade away.\n\nI moved out of this house, which was sold soon after. I never saw moving lights or felt the hand on my shoulder again. I believe my family\u2019s unfinished business was to see me grow up and finally move on. This thought often gives me peace in my heart.\n\nHas anyone else experienced such a thing that concluded in a poignant way?\n\nEDIT:\nWow, this really blew up more than I expected (I certainly didn\u2019t expect a gold). Thank you all so much for your kind and heartfelt wishes and comments. Hearing your input really makes me think that when a bond is strong enough it transcends the \u201cnormal\u201d. I hope all of you can experience such love that I felt from that hand on my shoulder. \n\nI will slowly take the time to reply to some of your lingering questions.\n\nEDIT2:\nThanks everyone again for your heartwarming comments. I\u2019m seeing some skeptical comments about the circumstances of the crash so I will copy my reply here:\n\n\nI cleared this up in another reply:\n\nEarlier in the same day there were reports that someone was driving erratically on the backroads where we were and possibly drink. When the police investigated our wreck they found skid marks consistent with tires typically found on those types of vehicles, and traces of white paint on our vehicle (ours was dark maroon).\nAlthough police put out an alert for this vehicle type, no one came forward (either they were from out of town, or were hidden by the locals (this is a very small town and we had only moved there a couple years prior so..)) \n\nSince no one came forward the official investigation couldn\u2019t say completely, but it was heavily insinuated this was the cause (drink driving in this area is extremely high, even during the middle of the day when this happened)\n\nIn the end, this is all what I\u2019ve heard from people in town and from reading local reports on the case, since I was still a baby when it happened. \nIf new information came out someday saying it wasn\u2019t a drink driver I would be happy as well, but I don\u2019t think it will after all these years unfortunately."}, {"id": "hpy5zu", "name": "Boyfriends house is haunted?", "n_comments": 6, "text": "Two months ago was The first time I stayed the night, my boyfriend and I were both sleeping around 2:00am when I had woken up from a dead sleep, I felt paralyzed and couldn't move and my vision was fixed on a tall (8 foot) man who's back was slouched like many old mens backs do, I felt like it was 30 minutes to an hour of me just staring at him and paralyzed.

I don\u2019t really know what was sharing the duplex with my family so I\u2019m not going to call it a ghost, demon, etc. My family moved into the residence when I was 10 or 11. I believe it was 2003 or 04. I moved out in 2011 when I was 19. It\u2019s been awhile so I apologize. I\u2019m estimating timeframes. Also, I\u2019m not religious and growing up I was more atheist. I\u2019m agnostic now. \n\nBefore moving in, my sister stayed the night at our new home. When the rest of us got there she had told my mother she didn\u2019t like the place. When I asked her what she meant she didn\u2019t answer me. I didn\u2019t feel any negativity. I was just excited to have some stability.\n\nNothing started out intense. In fact I can\u2019t really pinpoint when the odd things started happening (in that house). I would say it started after my weird trip in the woods but my sister felt something so I\u2019m gonna say it must have left me alone, at first. \n\nWhen I would lay in the living room I noticed a weird shadow on the ceiling. It looked like a head and shoulders. I thought it was just a weird trick of the eyes but as time progressed I noticed more & more shadow \u2018heads and shoulders\u2019 joining it on the ceiling. \n \nThen I noticed these shadows developing above my bed. Nowhere else in the house just the living room directly above the couch and directly above me bed. I moved my bed when my sister moved out and the shadows started developing where I moved my bed. I told my mom and she couldn\u2019t explain what it was. Landlord checked it out but nothing came from it. \n\nI started to have nightmares/intense dreams.\n\nIntense Dream #1: Started out as me sleeping. I woke up (which felt very real btw) walked into the living room and the door was open. I walked up to the screen door and looked out. I saw the moon separate into 4 separate moons one on top of the other. I ran to tell my mom so she could look outside but the house was dark and empty. It didn\u2019t really feel like my house but it was. I went to my bedroom and looked out the window and the moons were still there. Then the Earth starts cracking and now I\u2019m outside watching dragonlike creatures escape from the cracks. I wake up. \n\nIntense Dream #2: Everyone in my neighborhood was standing outside. I walk outside. They were looking in the direction of the sun. The sun went dark and dark creatures appeared. Chasing and killing people. I ran to the woods behind my house. I could feel everything. The grass between my feet and it smelled so fresh. Just as something was coming for me everything went white and I heard a man. He told me to help them and sent me back to the woods. I wake up. \n\nIntense Dream #3: I was floating above the Earth and there was a tree below me, sky above me. The land below me was barren except for that one tree. The atmosphere divided into separate layers. There was light but no sun. Then I was floating over Earth seeing everything. A being came to me. We talked, I don\u2019t remember exactly what he said but he was tall and blue.\n\nIntense Dream #4: I am floating and I see the pyramids. A large group of people were leaving and a man came to me. I asked him what was happening and he replied they had to leave. Then everything went white and I woke up sweaty breathing hard. \n\nIntense Dream #5: A man is knocking at my door. I opened it. He is wearing Black, holding a bound book in one hand, smirk on his face and as I look up he has many faces. Heads stacked one on top of the other as high as I could see. He told me without moving his mouth I could have anything I wanted. I just have to ask. Something felt wrong so I tried to keep my wish to myself & I woke up terrified. \n\nIntense Dream #6: I  hear loud water dripping. It was loud and echoed in my head like an alarm. As I woke up the sound faded to where I couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. I went to use the bathroom and as I got close I heard a faint dripping from the faucet. There\u2019s no way I heard that from the bedroom but I knew that\u2019s what the noise was. \n\nIntense Dream #7: I see a bright light and I am flying. I see a brick house. A little girl about 3 is playing outside. She reminds me of my deceased grandmother. The house seemed to be located nowhere but I follow her in the house. She seemed scared of me. She ran into her room to play with dolls and I watched from a corner. Then I started to feel chest pains. Like a knife in my heart. The most intense pain I\u2019d ever felt. The pain goes away and I was surrounded in light. I started to wonder where I was. My family and memories started to flash in my mind. I couldn\u2019t see my memories but whenever I thought of a family member/memory I immediately forgot.  Like my mind was being wiped. Once I realized what was happening I tried not to think of my mother but as soon as I did she was gone. I no longer knew who I was or my family. A woman called to me. She told me to go back. I can sense someone next to her. Possibly another woman. She tells me it isn\u2019t my time. I kept arguing screaming why and I woke up with my face in the pillow struggling to breath. My face was wet. I\u2019d been crying. \n\nThese dreams happened in the duplex when I was between 11-18. I also want to point out I\u2019ve had intense dreams all my life. When I was younger I\u2019d wake up screaming at night and I had a very hard time waking up. The night terrors stopped when I was 6 but started up again when I moved into my new home in \u201803. I still get them once in a blue moon but I know how to wake up now. \n\nI apologize if my story is all over. I\u2019m just trying to capture everything correctly. I\u2019m going to post more of my experiences because I feel a sense of relief.

The white was an absolute pristine color, not even slightly brown or cream. It\u2019s face was split down the center perfectly with the colors opposing one and other. They also followed down his entire back that way, completely half and half. He stared at me for what felt like 10 minutes, which was more likely no longer than a minute. He stood there, no body language saying much of anything. No fear, no anger, nothing. Just stood there, existing for a split second in time. I really couldn\u2019t leave him, so I called to him trying to get him to come near me. But he turned calmly, showing us his entire black side and within an few moments he disappeared as if out of thin air. We took off after him in our car literally seconds afterwards and he was gone.

So I\u2019m starting over. \n\nAbout 8-9 months ago, my mom informed me that my parents have a ghost in their house. Now, my childhood was strange when it came to spirits. We didn\u2019t have a lot of activity, but we had enough for me to absolutely believe. I had never visually seen one though. Just heard things and a lot of times, things would disappear into thin air and my mom would call out loud asking for it back and it would reappear. I was never scared in any of the homes we lived in, even though strange things would happen that had no explanation. \nSo, on to the current ghosts. My mom informed me that my sister woke up in the middle of the night, and a woman was standing at the foot of her bed. My sister was obviously terrified as she had no idea who this woman was, but as soon as my sister sat up in bed, the woman calmly walked out of the room. My sister could not see her face, her hair was covering it. As an adult now, I kind of blew it off thinking she had a bad dream, even though I still believe in ghosts, but it just sounded like a dream to me. \nNow, my dad is very much into science. Big Bang, all of that. Nothing spiritual whatsoever. Well, my dad starting seeing this woman. ALWAYS only around the kitchen, my little sisters room and her \u201cliving room\u201d all in the same area of the house. My dad said he has seen her walk out of my sisters room or living room into the kitchen countless times, and several times peeking around the corner at him from the kitchen as he sits in his chair. This made me believe even more because he\u2019s never believed in any spiritual things, and he was adamant this has been a continuous thing he\u2019s been seeing. My mom, however, had never seen this woman, and was pretty bummed honestly. \nShe did not seem to wish them harm at all. She just wanders around the kitchen and two bedrooms. Back and forth. \nSo anyway, one night, my boyfriend and I were having a bit of issues and I went to stay at my parent\u2019s house. We\u2019re all sitting in the living room on the couches eating a casual dinner when I very clearly watched a woman, with dark curly hair, walk out of my sisters room and into the kitchen. My sister has curly hair and had just taken a shower, so her hair is darker when wet, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Until I turned to my left, and my sister was sitting next to me. When I tell you all of the blood drained out of my face and I was pale as a piece of white paper....oh. My. God. I could not even speak. My family noticed my reaction because I had looked at my sister then back and kind of muttered, but then they saw my reaction. My jaw was dropped, my eyes filled with tears, I couldn\u2019t speak, and I was absolutely terrified. My mom, on the other hand, excitedly screamed \u201cOH MY GOD YOU SAW HER DIDNT YOU!!!!\u201d She was so jealous because she hadn\u2019t seen the woman yet, and she also felt relieved that someone else saw her other than them. \nI don\u2019t know why it scared me so terribly bad because, like I said, she obviously does not intend to harm my family. She\u2019s literally just been wandering around that one side of the house. But, to have seen a ghost in real life, not just experienced strange, unexplained events, I was absolutely terrified. \n\nKind of just wanted to share my story, and kind of wanted advice. I\u2019ve always believed in the paranormal, but for some reason, I absolutely could not handle witnessing it visually firsthand.\n\nETA: TL;DR: I\u2019ve had a whole childhood of dealing with paranormal events but recently visually witnessed a spirit and it scared the absolute hell out of me."}, {"id": "hpvn60", "name": "Little Experiences", "n_comments": 1, "text": "So when I was younger, I used to see/hear/witness a lot of weird and possibly paranormal things. Now, my mom is super spiritual and I think she's always been that way. In the past five years, she's sort of influenced my view on the world. I don't know if this is really that important, but weird things have stopped happening around me in the past...three years? Yeah, three years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have dozens of little experiences, but I'll keep this short for everyone's sanity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo start, when I was a toddler, my parents, older brother and I all lived in a house in what was a cute suburban neighborhood. It's all older now and not as modern. It was a nice house with a huge back yard. Or so it seemed to me in my tiny 4 year old body. Though, we had a creepy neighbor who had a great view of our yard from his deck in *his* backyard. His house was on the corner of a street, meaning the yards were perpendicular. Well, in the fence separating out backyard's, there were small holes. As one would expect from actual wood(not fake stuff that most tables are made out of). I used to like to peep through a hole in the fence.\n\nThis guy had two large dogs that would often jump the fence and run wild in the neighborhood. Several times my brother, nephews' and I would have to run past his house because his dogs' heads reached well over the top of the fence. It was rare that his dogs were quiet and seemingly nice.\n\nWell, one day, the entire family were out back. I was doing kid stuff and ended up looking through the hole in the fence. I saw a girl who looked a lot like Shirley Temple, sitting next to one of the dogs. It was really weird. It wasn't like she was far back, on the deck or something. From how I remember it, it was like looking through a paper tube. It's hard to explain, but there was nothing around the girl and the dog. It was just them.\n\nI was more amazed in a childish way than freaked out. In my toddler mind, I was probably excited about the neighbor having a little girl who I could potentially befriend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, we get to skip about a decade and a half. Back in 2016, my mom and I were living with my grandparents. My mom, brother and I had gotten out of a bad situation the year before which left us in the basement of my ex-stepsister's best friend's, family's basement. Yeah, it's a mouthful. According to the family, the house was haunted. The oldest daughter had experienced some things, such as someone sitting at the foot of her bed at night. I never did, and I honestly can't remember if anything paranormal happened. Most of the weird things that did happen could honestly be chalked up to paranoia or something else.\n\nLike I said, we moved in with my grandparents. It was late 2016. My brother moved in with his girlfriend of the time, leaving mom and I to stay with grandma and grandpa. Once again, we were stuck in the basement. The situation at hand took place during the summer of 2017.\n\nThe greatest part about being the youngest in your family is being able to stay home alone while everyone else goes out to work. I decided to stay at my dad's house for a couple of weeks, as a sort of vacation. My dad is a chill guy, so he doesn't expect much. Plus, it was good to get out of a crowded, tiny home. (five people in a two level house that is practically a town house. not fun.) My dad did live in a pretty busy neighborhood, with loud neighbors behind the house. Again, this might not be exactly paranormal, but I'm convinced it's something.\n\nIt was nearing the end of my stay at my dad's, and like usual, I was left alone with only the bird and dog for company. I was sitting on the couch, watching TV and writing, when the doorbell rings. I know, it's such a normal thing, but it was odd. I wasn't too immersed in my writing that I wouldn't have heard someone walk up to the door. In fact, the dog should have heard whoever it was, too. I checked out the windows first, which had a great view of the front steps. No one was there. No cars parked out front or in the driveway. I knew I wasn't going crazy because the dog reacted to the doorbell, too. She didn't growl, but she did a little 'boof' and stood up. I took a few extra minutes to check around the house to make sure no one was around. I ended up chalking it up to a prank, probably from the kids who lived behind us. Another few days pass by and I'm back home, having completely forgotten it.\n\nUntil it happens again. Once again, at home -my mom's-, I'm all alone with just the animals. Then doorbell rings. The dogs react, I get up and check out the window. No one is there. I wait a minute, to see if it's a sales person and if they'll walk away. Nothing happens. I check another window, same results. At that point, I remember what happened at my dads and I'm freaking out a little. I actually check with my dog to make sure he heard it too, and that I wasn't going insane.\n\nLike I said: It might not be paranormal, but it's one hell of a coincidence. My mom thought it might've been my guardian angel trying to tell me something. Dunno what the doorbell ringing could possibly tell me, but okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to jump back a few years, before we moved back into the city. Yes, we moved out to the country. Again, this takes place during the summer.\n\nSo, my ex-stepdad was a real jerk. That's being very nice about it. Any way, during the days us three kids were at home all day, we were expected to stay busy all day. That was actually how it was all the time. From the moment we wake up to the moment we go to bed, we're expected to just keep moving. So, for me, it wasn't entirely uncommon to feel a little anxious when I sit down for an hour during the day. As most kids and teenagers would, we ignored out chores well until the last minute -for the most part.\n\nIt was around either 2 or 3 in the afternoon, and my brother, stepsister and I had all gotten sucked into the TV. We were just about to get started on the chores when something caught our attention on TV. All of a sudden, my mom calls for us. A very clear 'KIDS!\" being shouted from upstairs. We all shout back \"coming!\" and race upstairs. The freaky part is that my mom wasn't home. We checked everywhere for a good while. Checked the bedroom, the garage, driveway for her car, the barn. Even the front of the house. My mom didn't get home until an hour later.\n\nThat is one of the most baffling things I've ever experienced. All three of us heard my mom call for us. To me, there's no way to write it off or debunk it."}, {"id": "hq01ez", "name": "Memories I thought forgotten resurfaced in a meditation", "n_comments": 0, "text": "Good evening all. I felt a strong urge to post this experience here, and maybe some folks could help me figure out what happened.\n\nTo begin, I was participating in a live stream of a group meditation where the focus was the cleanse yourself of energy no longer serving you. I struggled with certain parts, mostly the part where you visualize your aura reaching out to connect to others. The one part of the meditation I REALLY felt something was when we went to cleanse the mind and i felt pressure on my forehead and around the back of the top of my head. It wasn't intense, more felt like a headache coming on but not there yet. Several memories from 2012 came to me.\n\nThe first memory was of me in bed one night. I was lying on my stomach with my face towards the wall away from the rest of my room. I had woken up because I felt something like a presence in my room. When I was about to turn to look I felt something enter my room and come close to me, so close it almost touched my back. Then, I felt a second presence, this one with ENORMOUS energy, so intense that it was pushing down on my body, into the bed. I could even feel my sheets move a little. I thought it was sleep paralysis but I moved my hand to test it and realize that wasn't it. As I lay there, with my face still towards the wall, it felt like these two energies were \"fighting\", like the first one had stepped into the territory of the second one. This lasted maybe a minute and then I felt one energy leave and the intense energy stay for a few seconds before also leaving. I laid there trying to figure out what happened before passing out to sleep.\n\nThe second memory was of me napping on the floor of my living room. I found it comfy, especially after work. As I was dozing off, I felt myself being \"dragged\" around the room and over furniture. It wasn't my body being dragged but it was still me, and my eyes were closed but I could feel it happening. I was taken back tk my place of origin in the center of the living room and I felt my body being forced to face the ceiling and my eyes were pushed open. I was looking at what I could only describe as something like a Nazghul from Lord of the Rings. I was being forced to look into the black void that was its face. There was a loud sound in my hears, like a wind tunnel. It was speaking to me, although i couldn't understand what it was saying, and trying to get me to speak back to it. Something in the back of my mind told me that if I let it hear my voice that would be a bad thing, so I fought hard to keep from talking. I could tell it was getting frustrating, its distorted words getting louder and more violent feeling. I then heard the words \"The book has been opened....doorway...\" very clearly before it attempted once more to get me to speak and vanished. My vision of the living room was no longer blurry, and loud wind sound was gone, and i was laying on my back looking at the ceiling fan.\n\nThe third memory was of me again napping on the floor in the living room again. The same Nazghul-like entity came to me but this time it got straight to the point and forced me to look at its void-face and get me to speak. This time I failed at keeping my silence and I screamed. It was rough and it felt like my voice had trouble coming out, but it came out anyway. It was only for a short time, but this time I felt that the entity wasn't frustrated but confused when I yelled and it disappeared.  Needless to say, I stopped napping on the living room floor lol\n\nThese event happened to me with only a week in between them, and also happened shortly after my dog of 15 years passed away. I was distraught with his passing and I believe my spiritual awakening started then and immediately went in a Dark Night, and i have been there until last month. The depression hit me hard for years and I couldn't even speak his name for years without tearing up. \n\nThese otherworldly encounters stopped suddenly when some stray cats started hanging out in the backyard of my house and I haven't had a genuine encounter like those for years.\n\nCould anyone give some insight on what even happened, what these beings are, and if im not getting these encounters anymore is it my fault?

I would be asleep, then I would slowly awake &amp; look across my room &amp; there would be this really creepy man who would be standing there, smiling at me. He would then proceed to walk towards me and be inches from my face, just staring with this creepy smile. I couldn\u2019t move or scream, as much as I wanted to. It was really terrifying. When he would disappear, I would finally be able to move and I would run into the bathroom where my mom was getting ready. I\u2019m not sure how long this went on, but it stopped when I moved to the new house.\n\nSo once we were in the new house, I was a little older and didn\u2019t see these \u201cpeople\u201d as often. But weird things started to happen in the new house, but it felt different. I would be fearful to do anything in the house at night, and I began to develop insomnia. I would just lay there frozen every night, trying to hide under my comforter.\n\nI would see a man in the kitchen a lot, he wore like a conductor hat almost, but I was never fearful of him. There was also a man in hunting clothing that I would see a lot in the backyard (which connected with the woods, we had a huge yard with tree swings, swing sets, trampoline, etc). There was an upper level of the yard closer to the woods where the man in hunting clothing would stand watching over me and my younger sister. I remember I told my dad about it one day when he was watching me and my dad got really concerned and ran to the back of the yard with bat, trying to catch this creep. He searched for like half an hour and didn\u2019t find anything. He just told me it was probably my imagination.\n\nMy dad was always one to be semi-quick to anger, however staying in this house for 15 years really took a toll on him, and he seemed so angry all the time. We had a family room in the basement and an extra bedroom which was used as my mom\u2019s office. My dad has his own office set up in the family room, which was under the living room and hallway upstairs of the ranch-style house. He would do late night work on the computer and then run upstairs screaming that   my sister and I were getting out of bed bc he heard us running back and forth in the hallway and living room. We\u2019d hear banging in the walls and he\u2019d accuse us of that, too. \n\nFast forward to me being 9yo, and my mom and dad separated and later divorced, my dad staying in the house. Still occasionally heard knocking and walking, but nothing too crazy. I later turn 12, and my pre-teen angst made me want to move to the bedroom in the basement so I didn\u2019t have to share a bunk bed with my sister anymore and could finally have my own space. I was only at his house 50% of the time with the custody schedule, but I could NEVER get a good night\u2019s sleep when I was there. I was so tired all the time bc the feelings I would get in that room would keep me up all night. Even the times I would fall asleep, i would wake up feeling extremely scared. \n\nI had a bathroom connected to my room, which had the laundry room on the other side of the bathroom wall. I would leave the bathroom open and lock my bedroom door at night as well. I would hear the door knobs start to turn on both doors, occasionally the bathroom would shut on its own, not a slam but still terrifying (I also want to note this room had no windows, but there was windows in the rest of the basement). There would be scratching on the wall between the laundry room and bathroom, even on my locked bedroom door. I\u2019d hear people walking upstairs long after everyone went to bed. \n\nFast forward to now, my dads attitude has completely changed after moving out of that house, we have a way better relationship than when we lived in that house. I\u2019m staying with my mom in her house now and I haven\u2019t had that feeling at all since I\u2019ve lived here. \n\nEdit: I almost forgot to mention my dad\u2019s ex used a ouija board after I moved out of my dads and said she found out there\u2019s multiple spirits in the house and there\u2019s one in particular that apparently hates my dad. My sister did it with the ex a few times and said there\u2019s a little girl who was attached to my sister from that house.\n\nEdit 2: I also just remembered that I was really upset over something that happened at school once and was crying, laying down on my bed, facing the wall. I suddenly sensed something walk behind me and freaking felt them sit on the bed, and LITERALLY PULLED MY CAMI STRAP, it snapped on my back! Only time something touched me. \n \nMy dad and I had also been talking at the bottom of the basement steps once and a ball of light (an orb) came shooting down the steps in between us and disappeared into the ceiling."}, {"id": "hptrw6", "name": "Just some small experiences.", "n_comments": 1, "text": "I grew up with family members who really believe in ghosts and spiritual things.

Everyone says my aunts house was really haunted, but I never experienced anything there. \n\nWhen I was living with my parents and brother, my brother and I shared a room. We had a bunk bed and the old metal frame would shake whenever anyone would touch it. One night, I was laying in bed, I felt the bed move and I figured my brother had climbed up to sleep. I called to him, and he answered \u201cyeah.\u201d I waited in silence for a few moments, before I realize he was talking to my mom in the living room. I counted to three and then booked it out of my room. We all slept in the living room that night. \n\nAnother time, my brother was sleeping and woke up to the bed moving. He called my name, and I answered \u201cyeah.\u201d He felt like he had to check if it was me, so he looked down and my bed was empty. He flew off the top bunk, and bolted to the living room, where I was watching tv. We both slept there again.\n\nAnother time, my entire family were going out to a restaurant for dinner, but I had to stay behind to finish an essay. Once everyone left, I cranked up the music and began writing. I started singing along really loudly and I heard a girl laughing at me. Like right behind me. I quickly turned the music off and turned around, there was no one there. I turned on my Xbox and joined a call with my friends, so I wouldn\u2019t be alone. \n\nA few months after that I was hanging out with some friends who lived in my neighborhood. I had to go get something from my house and my buddy followed me. I walked in and turned left to the kitchen. My buddy thought I went to my room, he went straight and turned right. I turned around in the kitchen, and was like where did he go? I walked back towards my room. He was standing in the hallway looking cautiously into the bathroom. I asked him what he was doing, and he jumped and said who else is here? I said, no one, why? He was spooked and said he heard a little girl laughing. We both bolted out of the house. I told him about that time I called them on Xbox and he freaked out. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve moved out and I haven\u2019t really experienced anything again.

It was a great experience, however - what experienced there will probably be with me the rest of my life. In fact, it is something I can\u2019t rationalise or explain to myself. \n\nAnyway. Here\u2019s some backstory.\n\nThere were four of us, driving around Europe in a Honda Jazz all the way from Scotland - plus musical equipment and clothes. Some venues (including this one) would offer accommodation and food on top of our fee which was amazing, and you can imagine, after being in cramped conditions on the road for 9 hours at a time - we weren\u2019t really wanting to turn anything like that down.\n\nAfter our gig, some of the band wanted to go out and see the local nightlife whereas myself, I just wanted to lie down, relax and just browse the internet - as we were coming to the end of the tour and I was in need of some downtime. \n\nWe were led up to our room which was above the bar (which we assumed would be a very basic room with a bed and bathroom) and led us into one of the most modern Airbnb\u2019s I\u2019ve ever stayed in. It was super clean, super high tech, two big massive bedrooms with king sized beds - with a shower and jacuzzi bath, massive kitchen and beautiful wooden floors.\n\nI decided to sleep on the floor of the living/kitchen room on my blow up mattress, which was open planned, and the linking communal room to the bedrooms and bathrooms. As my band mates were getting ready to go out on the town, I saw a leaflet on the kitchen table that said that this building had been around SINCE 1260, which was an incredible as you would never know as the building and bar had been renovated to the point that you didn\u2019t really see any of the old designs anymore. \n\n\nSO.\n\nI said goodbye to my band mates as one of them mentioned they were going to have a bath when they got back. I shrugged it off and asked him to be quiet and to try and not wake me, as my bed was real close to all the doors as it was in the middle of the communal room. After they had left, I turned over and went to sleep pretty quickly........\n\nI woke to the sound of a dripping tap. It was pretty dark but my eyes adjusted fast, the lights of the city were coming through the cracks in the blinds. My first reaction was being mad at my band mate for not turning the taps off properly after he had a bath (turns out later that he never ended up having one). I turned over and saw it was about 3:30AM on the wall clock. I threw the blankets over my head and closed my eyes again....\n\n\n\nThen IT happened:\n\nWhat almost felt like a large weight come down on the bottom left corner of my bed. If you\u2019ve ever been on a bouncy castle and when weight is distributed from one side and inflates the opposite side.. except this launched me about an an inch in the air. This was the first time I had felt real, sobering fear. Like an ice shock down my spine; probably the adrenaline in hindsight. \n\nI remember I stopped breathing, my heart was racing and it was silent in the room. I felt it again, this time less abrupt, more like a kid nudging you for attention. I remember thinking, \u201cThis isn\u2019t in your mind. This is actually happening.\u201d \n\nTerrified, I threw the blankets off me and looked down towards the foot of my bed. I didn\u2019t see anything at first until I looked further back beyond the dining table, which maybe two feet from the foot of my bed, I noticed a shape. I blinked several times to be sure but I swear I saw a girl, with no face and long hair down to her feet. She was about 5\u20196, pale as anybody could be and she almost looked sodden. As if she had been in the rain. \n\nI tried to scream but I couldn\u2019t and I threw the blanket over myself and told myself to go to sleep. I don\u2019t remember falling asleep, but when I woke up, I saw one of my band mates sitting at the dining table doing some work on his laptop. I was so relieved that it was daytime, I sprang up immediately and told him what happened. Of course, half asleep and rantings of a ghost... he told me it was a dream and to calm down.\n\nMy other band mate, Gary - who had slept in one of the bedrooms, woke up and joined us. He looked pale as a sheet. I asked him if he was ok but assumed he was just hungover from last night\u2019s antics. When we had packed our things, two of the boys went and got the car while Gary and I minded our belongings in the lobby over a cigarette and coffee. I asked Gary how he slept and before I could say anything he replied,\n\n\n\u201cMate you would not believe me if I told you.\u201d\n\n\nI stared at him for a couple seconds and asked what had happened, thinking it was a bar story or a funny story perhaps. I couldn\u2019t of been more wrong. Let\u2019s also state that Gary and I are skeptics - which doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t believe in ghosts, just we are the type of people that need proof before blindly believing anything. \n\nHe began to tell me in the middle of the night, someone had got into bed with him. He had awoken to the feeling of the blanket lifting up and someone sliding in next to him. He told me that he was too petrified to move or call out and just tried to make himself fall asleep like me. And he never had the bath he intended to take. So that explained why he looked pale white when he woke up, he was not intending to tell anyone because it sounded so unbelievable... \n\n\nWe stared at each other for a while and said we\u2019d never sleep another night in Zurich.\n\n** EDIT: After some research as it has been a couple years, I verified the place with my band mates. It is between altstadt and grossmunder, Ankengasse 4, 8001 Zu\u0308rich, Switzerland.

Every night I sit on my back porch and look at the stars. Back in April I was doing just that, it was around 10:00 PM and I was sitting on the top step. I found Venus in the night sky and I was mesmerized by its constant red flaring from the solar radiation. Their was 3 stars surrounding Venus, one to the bottom left, one to the top right, and one to the bottom right. As I was staring at the planet, I noticed that the star at the bottom right began to move. I have been looking in this same point in space for a solid 5 minutes before it started to move. It went up and up, gradually getting faster and faster. Now to me, it looked like it was going up. But I was looking South, so it may have been moving North but from my position, it looked as if it were traveling straight up. After 2 minutes of watching this object get farther/closer to me, it disappeared into the black abyss. \n\nI know what your thinking, stars can\u2019t just decide to travel away from its respective solar system and yeet itself off into space on a whim. And you\u2019re right, but, something very very strange happened tonight at 9:30 EST. It\u2019s a very clear sky tonight and I can see millions of stars in my sparsely populated neck of the woods. As I was watching Venus flash it\u2019s brilliant red colors, I noticed that exact same \u201cstar\u201d was in the exact same position. To the bottom right hand side. I watched it intently. Looking to either side of it to help my eyes identify movement. And sure enough, after 10 minutes of manic staring and anticipation, it began to travel \u201cup\u201d. The hairs on the back of my neck and my arms stood up so fast it\u2019s as if they were trying to rip themselves out of the follicles. I got an Incredibly uneasy feeling in my stomach. Their was no flashing, no sound, nothing to identify it as a plane. And planes that don\u2019t have VTOL capabilities can\u2019t just chill in the air. And I\u2019ve never, ever seen a plane travel this fast. It must have been going Mach 12 or 13, literally the fastest thing I\u2019ve seen in my life. And it accelerated from stationary to extremely fast instantaneously. By the time I stood up to get a better look of where it was going, it was gone, completely vanished.\n\nI was sitting on the top step looking up at the sky, completely stunned by what I just saw. I knew I wasn\u2019t imagining it anymore. I lit up a cigarette and smoked half of it in 3 hits. I ashed over the bannister and looked back up. \u201cOh, my, fucking, God...\u201d slipped from my lips. Their were and entire fleet of these \u201cstars\u201d that I\u2019ve been looking at for over an hour, move in the same direction as the first one. I counted 26 consecutively before I succumbed to my gut feeling and went inside. \n\nI do not live near an Air Force base, or any other military base or outpost. I do not live anywhere close to an airport. The same \u201cstars\u201d return to exactly where they were the next night after my experiences. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time.

But I'm not sure that's who haunted my house. I lived there for 10 + years so there are too many stories to type. I could honestly write a novel or have a small Netflix series on this house but I'll write out the last experience I had and go from there . My parents had lost their house in the market crash back in 2008 or so . But before this happened I had moved out but returned to have dinner with my parents.my mom was still at work and dad had left to the store down the street to get some soda and whatever else he needed leaving me there alone . I was sitting in the living room watching tv and I can feel a presence staring at me. The same uncomfortable looming feeling I had felt pretty much all my life.like when I was going up the stairs from the basement when I was younger I felt this looming mean mugging feeling. wanting me to leave I would even feel a force on my lower back kinda pushing me up the steps,or maybe this things look was that strong. Anyway at this point I'm 17 maybe 18 feeling tough and I can feel this thing mean mugging me.i had never seen it but if I had to guess it felt like this thing was very tall and gangly,and would kinda hunch over and give me this dark look that would go over your whole body.anyway I'm watching tv trying to ignore this thing and finally look over into its direction and say . You know I'm not afraid of you anymore right? As soon as I said that the pot of boiling water my dad was cooking some eggs in flew off the stove and crashed to the floor. I screamed a very involuntary aaaaggghhh followed with an ok man you win. I just sat there after about 10 minutes my dad came back saw the mess and asked what happened I told him and he just kinda shrugged it off and began to pick the eggs off the floor. That was his reaction because things like this happened all the time for years.another if your still reading this is in 9th grade a friend of mine slept over and we were playing video games he wanted me to teach him to play iron man on guitar.i said sure man right after this gta mission. After a few more gta missions he asked again,and not wanting to stop playing I gave some lame excuse like oh I cant remember how it goes, I would have to hear it . Then boom my 5 disc CD player turned on. When it turned on the disc tray would rotate and play the first CD first song. This thing flips all the way to disc 3 and plays what? Yup, iron man, not even the first song on the cd. I put the controller down picked up my guitar and started jamming out iron man. My friend at this point was like WTF . I just looked at him and said yeah man I told you this place is haunted.

We were young and had fun communicating to each other by sending each other useless little things in the mail. Drawings, candy, a rubiks cube, etc. At the time, I had just began guitar lessons. My friend sent me a guitar pick in a letter, saying he had found it while on a walk and it made him think of me. It was a very uniquely colored pick, I had never seen one like it before. Cool. I kept the guitar pick in the same exact spot inside of the guitar case. \nFew days later, I came home from school and my mother brought me the guitar pick saying she had found it in our family living room. Not too odd, I may have dropped it or misplaced it. I carefully put it back in the spot I always kept it. Few days later, I opened my binder at school and the guitar pick fell out. \nI decided to send the guitar pick back to my friend, as we had been joking about it being \u201chaunted\u201d or \u201cparanormal\u201d.  He got the letter, with no guitar pick inside. I rushed home from school, to find it nicely propped up against a book on my dresser. I could not believe my eyes. I thought my mother had been playing a trick on me. \nEight years later, and four different living locations later, I still find it in different places in my new houses.

It all started when we first moved into our apartment. I was doing laundry and at this point had done multiple loads since moving in. When pulling out the laundry from the washer I heard a clink at the bottom. At the bottom was a small pendant of the Virgin Mary. Neither me or my roommate had ever seen it. I set it aside and didn\u2019t think much of it. Soon after though we would hear the dryer door pop and slowly open. It creeped us out but we didn\u2019t think much of it and blamed it on a faulty door. This continued on many more times. As time went on even the washer would turn on and being to fill on it\u2019s own.\n    A month or so later after moving in the TV in the living room would turn off and on randomly.  Then one night closing my eyes to go to sleep my tv  turned on. After being annoyed I yelled, \u201cIf you think this is funny do it again!\u201d I hadn\u2019t even finished the sentence before the tv turned back on. Right after it was a bang on the wall. The wall is shared with a spare bedroom we have that is not currently occupied .The coincidence of it all had me very creeped out but I convinced myself that the neighbors must have a similar tv that is interfering. Though still very freaked my roommate and I decided to sleep in the livingroom. During the night I awoke to a figure standing in the corner of the room. I could see the outline of the person due a nightlight behind it. I tried to speak to wake my room mate but couldn\u2019t due to fear. She though all of sudden jumped up and ran over to the nightlight in anger ripping it out complaining it was too bright. I was in dismay as I was trying to tell her don\u2019t because the shadow figure was standing over there.\n    This next story is from my roommate. She has the master bedroom of the apartment that has a private bathroom. It was late at night and she was in bed reading and cuddling with her cat. She had even sent me a Snapchat of the two them cuddling. She decided to call it a night and had gotten up to use the bathroom before going to bed. While in the bathroom she heard her bedroom door begin to shake. She was freaked that someone was trying to break in and grabbed a bat. To open her door she had to first move a box fan and then unlock the door. When she finally opened it she found her cat on the otherside . There was no explainable way for how she got out there.\n\n    As time went on things got more scary as the knocks began happening every night along with the sound of something being thrown at my door. We later began finding mysterious wine corks outside my door which explained the noise but not how they got there.  One night I had came home late from a friends house. I thought I was home alone because my roommates keys weren\u2019t hanging up by the door and her room was silent with no fan on like I said before she normally has on. I had just turned the lights off and was laying in bed when in the spare room I could hear what sounded like the pump for the air mattress had turned on. It was extremely loud and I could hear footsteps in the hallways outside my door. Next through the crack of my door I could see a bright light shining back and forth as if there was a flashlight or if someone had the light on their phone on. My first thought was someone again had broken in and I had my phone ready to call 911. I heard the person exhale deeply and then everything went quiet. I finally got brave enough to open the door and was opening the door the spare room when I see the tv in the living room turn on. It begins to loudly play a creepy soundtrack with no actual video. I run and quickly rip the plug out of the wall. The next day I notice on Netflix the first thing to pop up was unsolved mysteries . The music was very similar to what I heard the night before. Even more weird the show skipped to episode 3 which was called house of terror.\n\n    The next evening we decide to be brave and sleep in the spare room to experience what was happening in there. Again the mysterious knocking was heard from the same wall which I heard from my room. While laying in the dark in the living room we begin to hear the same creepy music heard the night before . We go out to look and nothing seemed to be turned on. So we being to go back to sleep when we hear in the living room again the voice of a little girl. My roommate and I both liked at each other in disbelief of what we heard. There was a moment of silence between the girl talking but again we started to hear her talk. It sounded like she was coming from a speaker because she was echoing. There was no other voices but her own. At the end we finally could understand what she was saying and she i kid you no said, \u201cAre you afraid of the dark.\u201d We both froze with complete fear.  At this point we have tried saging the apartment many time but never seemed to help just making it come back worse.\n \n      One evening the knocking kept happening in my room and my anxiety kept rising so I decided to bring the air mattress into my roommates room. Again I was about to fall asleep when I feel something hit me. Freaked out that it was a bug ,I soon realize it was one of my room mates hair ties. What creeped me out the most was that I could tell it was dropped straight above me which was impossible. After I calmed down and was finally relaxing I felt hard tug on my foot as if something was trying to yank me out of bed. It was at this point I felt a new level of horror. This could throw things and grab me what else was it capable of? \n   The next day i focused a lot on my Christian religion and prayer a lot to God for protection and for guardian angels. I placed a crucifix above my door in hopes of extra protection. That night my roommate decided to camp in my room to experience what I had been going through. As normal almost like a nightly routine the sound of something being thrown at my door happend with nothing outside to explain it . Before falling asleep that night we searched to my room to make sure there was no hair ties to be found in my room. While laying there again I felt something hid my back along with hit the sheets. It was loud enough for both of us to hear it. I couldn\u2019t believe it again it was a hair tie . I was frozen in complete shock I thought I was going crazy. After settling down once again I felt something wrap itself around my ankle with a cold grip.  At this moment I felt like I was being targeted and was not going to be apart of whatever this thing had planned. The next day I went full force with saging and using santo palo to cleanse the place. I placed salt in every corner of the apartment . I used anointed oil from Jerusalem on every door, window and mirror. I prayed like I never prayed before to get rid of this negative energy.\n\n  Things were pretty quiet for a few days and I held out hope that this was finally over. Until I was sitting on my bed today home alone. I all of a sudden felt a horrible burning pain on my back. It felt as if someone was putting out a cigarette on my back. I jumped up and ripped my shirt off thinking a bug was biting me. I ran into the bathroom and couldn\u2019t see anything until three scratch marks started to appear. I couldn\u2019t not believe what I seeing. I feel as if I\u2019m being stalked by something I can\u2019t see. I am helpless and don\u2019t know what to do at this point.

And for some reason my wife looked back over her shoulder and down the hall way, and noticed that the light in my 10 year old daughters bedroom was on.

I told her how we went to Yosemite national park and she told me about a spirit bear that protects yosemite and she also told me if I treated the forest with respect the bear would protect me from any harm, but if I harmed the forest the spirit bear would drive me out to never return. Safe to say I stuck with her advice as I always treated the forest with respect whenever I would go to Yosemite. However this memory faded away until I was at work and something about how the wind blew in the trees reminded me of what she said.

One night she woke up and saw that her bedroom door was open, and when she woke up my brother to check on my nephew, he found him sitting indian-style at the end of their bed staring at the closet. My brother had to call to him about 3 times before he slowly turned his head and looked at him. \n\nFast forward to today: my nephew is now 7 years old. He approached my sister in law and asked her if she remembered when he would get up in the middle of the night and act weird, and if she remembered him saying that he saw a face. She said yes, and he started to describe the face that he had seen. He said that it was looking at him through the window. He described it as an extremely hairy face, with legs just going everywhere. He said it had about 8 legs, and was extremely ugly. He claimed it just looked at him through the window before running away. My sister in law did some investigating online and she found a picture of Beur the Demon. She saw some comments from other people and they\u2019re experiences were the same as my nephews. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this before, or know of someone that has?? \n\n****** Rather than Posting 2 separate posts I\u2019m putting both experiences in one***** \n\nMy sister in law was taking a nap on the couch one day with my niece sleeping in the bassinet on the floor next to her.

She wasn\u2019t fat, but she had some meat on her bones. \n\nA few weeks later, my niece tragically passed away.

Upon finding this they reburied the remains, and called a native priest to come and bless the land.  They ended up moving the foundation over about 50 feet to build their house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to when I was a child, and a teenager.  I would always hear my name being called from what sounded like family members, but nobody was home.  There were a multitude of years that this went on, and I would seek help and understanding for what was going on.  Nothing ever came of my search for answers, it was always put off as an imagination.\n\nHere is where things start getting weird, I remember one night in particular, it still gives me extreme emotions thinking about it today, 12+ years later.  I was sitting in the basement playing Call of Duty 4, home alone as was par with all of my paranormal experiences.  All of a sudden, crisp as day, I hear a little girl singing a song in what sounds like an ancient language.  Nothing I have ever heard before or ever again.  I sit there frozen just listening to her, until this great amount of fear takes over my body.  I bolt up from my chair and go to walk to the stairs and that is when it happens.  It was like I walked into a freezer.  I am completely frozen at this point, and I'm sure you could smell the terror on me.  I was stuck there in this spot for what seemed like forever, when it just went away. \n\nLater that night I had a dream about a little girl in a white dress, who was singing a song.  The same girl that I had heard while playing games in my basement.  This memory has stuck with me, clear as day for the better part of the last 12 years, always in the back of my mind.  When I told people at the time what had happened, it was brushed off as a mental illness of some sort, but I *know* that was not the case.\n\nYears later I come to find out that the burial ground that is next to my house, was a burial ground for kids.  Yikes.  I know that my parents did all they could to put those spirits back to rest when they inevitably accidentally dug them up.  I think about the girl from time to time, and wonder what her story was..\n\nIf I think of anything else to add that I have forgotten I will add it, but as for that, this has been my story.

If you want the simple answer, skip to the last paragraph, if you want to know my full story I elaborate on, its all in this post of my progression of overcoming. \n\nI used to be terrified of the dark, of ghosts. Growing up was a royal pain in the ass as far as sleepovers. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I called home because I was too afraid to spend the night at a family/friends house. Blaming it on having a stomach ache or simply not feeling good is easy to spot and people catch on fast and it gets embarrassing.\n\nI grew up in a household of lukewarm believers in God, that is knowing of God but not knowing God himself, not knowing Gods nature, being completely unaware of everything about God and what he\u2019s capable of. I went a lot of my life not even thinking about God, you know, being a teenager and such, growing up and people in school would be talking ghost stories or the Bloody Marry story that was fake. I don\u2019t know if anyone remembers that fake tale but. Anyway I used to fear the dark, I used to hop in bed with my parents when I was real little, my brother today is even terrified to sleep on his own and he is 27. \n\nI have been into watching ghost stories when I was real little, used to freak me the F out, of course I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep that night or nights followed. With that Bloody Marry story I remember I didn\u2019t even wanna go in the bathroom cause I was afraid to look in mirrors. \n\nWasn\u2019t until I got older I felt a strong gravitation pole towards God that I cannot explain at all. Whenever I stayed the night with my cousins when I was younger, in the mornings my aunt and uncle took us all to church that I was never fond of. I was always bored, never payed attention to mass, zoned out, thought about what games my cousin and I would play after church let out, I just wasn\u2019t interested.\n\nI seen a woman when I was about 6 years old, staring at me at the end of my hallway, I thought it was my mom. She had no facial expressions but I kept calling \u201cmom\u201d out to her, no response. I began walking to her only until half way she turned around and hovered into my bedroom to disappear into thin air.\n\nI\u2019ve had a ton of experiences throughout my entire life, but never anything evil. NEVER, just experiences, in fact I\u2019ve had an experience just 2 weeks ago and it waited till everyone went to bed to act up on me. \n\nAs I got older, around 19-20 years old I felt a complete shift in what I liked, what I loved. God just became very apparent in my life, I\u2019ve had very very bizarre things happen to me that cannot he explained, I\u2019ve had near death experiences that I have been saved from and it definitely wasn\u2019t nature that saved me. I even had a time I was driving to my friends for a party, thinking about God in my head, and my radio station went static and tuned right into what I could hear a group of Women singing \u201cPraise the Lord\u201d then went static back to my music within seconds. Weird! \n\nI had times where I was thinking about God in my head while even showering, and the lights flicked off and then went on within half a second and only happened the time I thought of God at that exact moment. I used to write \u201cLove Jesus\u201d with a cross on the steam on my mirror as well.\n\nI was starting to hunger for God, I wanted to learn more, this came completely out of nowhere. I went from a lukewarm, to someone now who knows a crazy amount about Demons, Angels, God, supernatural, spirituality, and the unknown. I truly think God has brought me on a path towards him, I\u2019ve felt a strong pole towards God for a great part of my life now. I find myself even talking to people about God every single day almost now and I\u2019m a nobody.\n\nOnce I started learning more and more about God, Jesus, and learning all these stories in the Bible. Through prayer. It became very clear to me that God is love, is stronger than anything, created all, created the Devil himself, and if you\u2019ve read the story about \u201cJobs\u201d it was an amazing story from the Bible and if not I highly recommend you to, it will change everything you know or at least really being incite into your life.\n\nThe more I seeked God out, the less scared I got of anything and everything. I always feel like Jesus is with me, even though I sin. I always feel like evil cannot hurt me, very strange feeling indeed. I don\u2019t know why, my mom bought me a necklace of Jesus when I was in 9th grade it was a gift, never take it off, it represents my relationship with Jesus Christ and shows him I\u2019ll never forget him and he\u2019s not a stranger to me but the Love of my life. Then she bought me a shield with words on it representing Gods Armor, which I\u2019ll never take off it\u2019s supposed to protect you from evil, but I\u2019ll tell ya I really really feel protected, I like almost don\u2019t ever feel pain even with anything, it\u2019s very bizarre. I just have such strong faith in God today, and from a man who never wanted to go to Church or was bored and now absolutely love the Bible and teachings about God, I hunger for it and I couldn\u2019t tell you what changed other than I love God and am beginning to learn more about God and won\u2019t ever stop. I don\u2019t fear the Devil or Demons, we have authority over them and God loves us, they had their chance and they failed. We have power in Gods name and faith will strengthen us. All is possible through God.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe in God or believe in someone or something else or nothing at all, this is a judgement free zone, no judgement going on, this was simply my experience growing up."}, {"id": "hpq10b", "name": "The Trip to CK...", "n_comments": 2, "text": "Okay first post ever lol. So this story takes place when I was in middle school around 7 the grade or so. Just a tad of info: I was raised pretty leniently and was allowed to go up to the gas station to grab drinks and junk food etc. I had a one of my best friends and my brother that went pretty frequently usually in anytime of the day and sometimes going around 8 or 9 wasn't uncommon although looking back it was a bad idea haha. Anyways we lived in a gated community and if you get past the borders of the northeast \"wall\" you are met with a road that leads up to the gas station (about a mile or so down).do we all three at around 9 headed down that street toward the station and on the north side was \"old people's\" mobile home and the south side had a small kinda ditch thing that drain water if it ever rained and also a wall to another old people's community(we lived right next to those type of neighborhoods. We had always used this route to get some goodies so we were all Inna good mood. I remember joking that we are like assassin's in assassin's Creed cause we would travel on the ditch side witch had a ledge that you can kinda \"tight rope walk\" on. So we were in high spirits and chugging. So this is the weird part. As we went down the road where there is no cars,traffic lights, or nothing maybe the only light came from the lamp posts that gave off enough light. And seemingly out of absolutely fucking nowhere like totally uncalled for a big enough flash of light blinded all three of us; like a picture with flash  had just been taken but times one hundred. Like I couldn't see shit, just a lotta of white. Ofc like a flash it was gone in an instance. So ofc we are trying to figure out what happened like wtf. We thoought maybe there was a camera that takes photos of cars speeding but there was none and the flash itself was so profound. I mean we were freaked out cause there also was nobody on the streets or nothing just quiet asf and that kinda elevated it tbh but after I mean we never talk about it but we all can recall it. After the flash we saw a few cars but that's about it. We def got our goodies and prob started to co-op game some left 4 dead or some. Idk if it's paranormal but I can't explain this. It was just so damn bright I couldn't even see anything and we all experienced it so idek.what are your thoughts tho I'd like to know.

So without giving too much detail, I did a 4 1/2 year stint as a Security Contractor for a company which is pretty well known and well regarded in the industry. During the 2014 invasion of the Chrimean Peninsula, after it was determined Russian Contractors were being used to invade the peninsula, a certain worldwide military organization decided to be cheeky and send contractors of it's own. And I, an 18 year old, only a few months out of this company's boot camp was sent along with a sizable force of other contractors. Our primary mission was to slow any progress the Russians made while evacuating towns and villages of pro Ukrainian residents who were susceptible to executions and other horrendous acts when their loyalty was discovered. Now I only was there 6 miserable weeks, and neither of these stories are my own but the sources are very reliable people and I trust that they wouldnt lie about such things. So the first one I'll tell is of Platoon 62.\nPlatoon 62, comprised of 2 squads of 12 men each and were solely tasked with evacuation duties. According to the 2 people who had told me what happened. P62 had called in at approximately 1445 Hours (2:45 PM) and notified command that they had encountered heavy incoming fire and that theyd be seeking an alternate route to their destination, and reported no casualties. At 1452 they called in again and advised they one truck had been hit by an explosive and that the vehicle was immobile, they said theyd be dismounting and moving to the other vehicles, reported that all 5 occupants had been injured but were able to move on their own. Multiple attempts to reach them fail after this,  2 hours go by and then the last call from them came in saying they had all been wounded, some dead and that they needed medivac. 60 additional contractors forming a QRF were sent to assist at the first sign of trouble at 1445, and at approximately 1800 they had finally arrived only to find all 24 dead in varying locations. So here's where the paranormal begins, the locals state that a firefight had infact started at around 1445, and ended after about an hour with the attackers making an aggresive push on the 2 squads they had ambushed, the locals state that they had gone out and checked on the contractors after the attackers had left and found several who were still alive but life saving attempts failed shortly after, most had been hit by gunfire and shrapnel multiple times, fearing the attacking forces would return the locals left, the locals were adamant that they had checked all 24 and that all had passed away before they had left, so who called in saying they needed medivac? It's possible someone lived and they didnt realize he was still alive, and he Roy Benavidez'd himself long enough to call for help, it's entirely possible the locals lied, or my fellow contractors lied, but regardless, I do know this, platoon 62 (not their real call sign btw) was lost on that date and that time, all 24 were killed in an ambush because they had gone down a road we knew had been mapped out for ambushes. We know most of their equipment was damaged in the ambush including most comms, and that the official information release states there were signs indicating someone had tried to save a few of them. Regardless of what happened, whether or not that last call for medivac ever came in, we lost 24 great guys that day just trying to save lives.\nTask Force Blitz. Task Force Blitz, or TF Blitz, or just Blitz as we called it, was a slow down task force formed to do as mentioned above and that was to slow down any advancement made by the Russians. Comprised of 150 contractors, it was formed early on, but my squad wasnt attached until I had been in country for about 3 weeks, none of this matters to the story, it just provides some background. It was not uncommon to be given maps that were heavily outdated or that were not complete leading to confusion when we stumbled upon roads or villages that werent marked on our maps, also its important to know that GPS was working, but due to the weather at the time, most of our GPS units werent functioning properly or reliably, hence why we relied on maps. While enroute to an assignment, the units in the front of our column reported a small cluster of approximately 20 houses and buildings approximately \u00bd mile east from the road we were on, of course our maps didnt show this village. It was decided early on that since we couldnt confirm previous teams had searched this village, we had to search it again, and so my Squad of 10 and another of 10 dismounted and approached joined by 2 armed interpreters, my squad approached from the southwest, the other from the northwest, maintaining comms while approaching we identified a gas station, about 15 total homes and apartment buildings, what looked to be a government type building, and 3 buildings I couldn't possibly identify, so little by little we clear each building, unfortunately we find a few deceased people along the way, thorough searches on our end find nothing. As we're wrapping up the other squad comes out with 2 children and a dog, all 3 appeared to be emaciated, and our medics began treatment while we established a defensive perimeter and waited for an evacuation platoon to come. The children were picked up. We carried on, later on, I got to talk to the guys who found the children and dog, and this is where the paranormal begins, whilst clearing out one of the apartment buildings, the members of the other squad who found them, who I'll call D (interpreter) T and P. T and P were point, while D covered the rear. All 3 encountered a locked apartment door, T and P confirmed the door handle was locked and door was firm in the closed position, so they prepared to breach it with a halogen when the door \"simply popped open before we could even get the bar in the door jam\" inside they heard what they perceived as a elongated whisper, which D stated was loud enough for him to determine it was something said in ukranian, he just couldnt confirm what exactly was said, they proceeded to hold their positions until additional contractors came to them, they entered the apartment and searched and found the 2 kids and dog in the living room closet, covered by several items of thick clothing, a woman was found down the hallway in a bedroom, she had been deceased for several days if not a week at that point, her injuries believed a result of a brutal assault. After the fact, before hearing this story it was confirmed an evac platoon had visited this village about 5 days before, followed 2 days later by another task force, neither reported finding the children or woman when clearing the village, though it was determined later on members of that evac platoon had committed crimes against women and children and the time frame of when they were there lines up with her death. What stands out is the locked door, they confirmed amongst themselves it was locked, and they were willing to risk any element of surprise both to that apartment everyone they hadn't cleared to break the door down before it \"simply popped open.\" I will say T and I worked together several times after our time in ukraine and he established himself as a great contractor, and he exhibited a great moral character, I know from my time with him he wouldnt feed into a lie, so I truly believe this happened. As far as knowing truly why that door popped open, I believe that woman, in the afterlife waited for her kids to greet them as they crossed over, knowing she couldnt save them, and did her best to protect them by locking the door when she saw our boys coming down the hallway, perhaps she realized they were different, perhaps she took a chance hoping theyd save her kids, regardless, the last I heard only the dog passed away, so she can rest knowing we saved them.\u00a0"}, {"id": "hppee6", "name": "Ghost at the Guard shack", "n_comments": 1, "text": "So for those of you who didn't read my other thread, I was a Security Contractor for 4 1/2 years, and worked both stateside and overseas. Most of our stateside contracts has us doing what some would describe as military police duties, just on a private level, so we do access control, patrolling, respond to 911 calls on facility grounds etc. Most of these locations are pretty rural, located in the western half of the United States, the kind of places you can still see the stars at night. This event happened in 2015, around May, and was probably one of the most WTF moments of my career at that point. Myself and another Contractor who I mentioned in my previous post, then called T but who I'll now refer to as \"Ty,\" were manning an entry point to a facility located approximately 4 miles away behind us. In front of us was approximately 2 miles of semi flat barren ground ended only by some hills, and behind us was the perimeter fence, approximately 9 feet high topped with barbed wire, with the earth behind that matching the earth in front of us, so on a sunny day or at night with a bright enough light you could easily see 1500 hundred in any direction with little to no concealment to anything larger than an extremely small animal. We sheltered in a small 12\u2019x 8\u2019 shack, powered with electricity and that had running water, the front and side windows could be popped out and upwards allowing fresh air in. So its about 0220 in the morning, it was sitting at around 60 degrees, Ty and I decided to turn the lights off both inside and outside of the shack so we could see the landscape better, it was a moonless night, slightly cloudy, the kind of night perfect for camping, but it was dark, i mean beyond 75 feet you couldn't really see anything beside lights off in the extremely far off distance. As we sat there waiting for nothing, liking posts on social media we both distinctly heard what sounded like a large quadrupedal animal approaching the shack, which was odd because neither of us had been briefed on anything like this occurring at this specific facility we were guarding. As we both turned around and began to look out the windows, neither of us could see anything but it got louder almost like it was getting closer. At this point you\u2019d expect to see at least an outline of something because it sounded like it was easily within 50 feet of us, but nothing. We both were confused and justifiably concerned, neither of us talked, we just listened and communicated with our concerned looks. This is what really f*cks with my head and his to this day, the closer it got the slower the steps got, and eventually it sounded like it went from being quadrupedal to bipedal, im talking it sounded like someone was now within 10 feet of our shack just casually walking around it. Believing our eyes to be deceiving us, we used the lights on our rifles to begin to illuminate the area, searching our respective sectors looking for anything, these lights were bright, the beams easily reaching out 250 feet not leaving much to the imagination and yet\u2026. Nothing, not a single thing, or person, but yet once we turned the lights off\u2026. The footsteps continued, I wouldve bet money I was dreaming if I was alone but I wasn't, I had someone with me confirming what I was experiencing was real. We began to talk amongst ourselves, night vision! Since we're working a night post, we're directed to bring our issued night vision goggles with us, so we use those, and start scanning, and we literally cannot see a damn thing, but we can still hear the footsteps, at this point we actually are so concerned for our safety we request help. In the meantime we leave the shack, helmets on, night vision on, and search the immediate area, its important to note the night vision provided less long distance vision than the flashlights, we disengaged the ENVGs and went back to flashlights, I mean we SEARCHED, kicked over rocks, tapped our feet in divets seeing if there was a secret hatch, nothing, it took our backup 20 minutes to arrive in the form of 2 half asleep supervisors in an ATV, we kind of agreed to make something up, anything reasonable. We heard those footsteps for roughly 15 minutes total, and I honestly don't know what it could've been, I worked that shack like 4 times before then and a handful of times after and nothing similar happened.

The only female/motherly figure I had really was my Grandma S. We were really close. When she got cancer and had to have surgery, I was the one she wanted to take care of her post-recovery. My sister and I spent several days at a time staying at her place growing up. She was divorced, so it was always just the three of us. \n\nMy grandma was always big into the paranormal. She told us about the time she saw my great grandpa's spirit in my home (my dad inherited the home after my great grandparents passed away, and I often saw what I believe was my great grandpa's spirit growing up as well). She told us other ghost stories and what not. There was one day where she had us write notes to a ghost and left it out on the table before going to bed. Things like that. She was super into the paranormal, and her love for it was passed to me.\n\nI remember at one point we were sat out by the pool. I was about 10, and my sister 7. Sister was swimming and my grandma and I were lounging. We got on the topic of ghosts and I asked for a sign when she died, like flickering the lights or something like that. Super macabre, I know. I forgot soon after that I even asked.\n\nWhen I was 11 or 12 she passed away. My family were trying to find her as she wasn't answering her phone and was expected to be at our family's house because it was Christmas Eve. I just knew she was dead. Idk man, just something told me. Eventually I was left home alone with my sister while my dad and his girlfriend went to check my grandma's house. While alone, I heard a knock on the door. I thought it was my sister so I told her to come in. When there was no answer, I searched for her. My sister was asleep, and was confused when I asked if she had just been at the door. \n\nIt took a few years for me to remember the conversation about wanting a sign. I believe that the knock was her just letting me know 'hey, I'm hanging around!' I didn't really get many signs after that. It would be another 10 years, when I'm into my early twenties, that I'd have enough experience related to her. \n\nI was going through some hard times. I was being emotionally abused by my dad's fianc\u00e9 and things were just really bad. Lots of trauma that I once locked away and forgot were being dragged up and I was struggling. \n\nEach time it started out the same. I was having a hard time in general and would go to bed. In the dream I'd be at my grandma's house. The first time I remember sitting in her room, talking to her. Her spirit was there but her body was also there and I was super confused. I remember asking, 'but you're dead, how am I talking to you?' and she just brushed it off. We'd go on to talk about what was bothering me and she'd comfort me and offer advice. \n\nAfter both of those dreams, I woke up crying. I have never done that before. It's creepy, and I wasn't a huge fan of it. I've talked a bit in my sleep before and I tend to roll around a lot but crying? It was an all time new and it left me feeling super weird. \n\nSince then things have been getting better and I haven't had those dreams again.

These creatures are assumed to be so highly advanced they would be like humans today to us living in the Stone Age which means a lot coming from the fact that we are the smartest beings amongst all the animals on Earth as we know it.\n\nMy point is, when you think of creatures who have been hiding amongst the human civilization for countless centuries, who have an arsenal of high tech equipment we have never been introduced to and wouldn\u2019t know even how to reverse engineer, we gotta think that maybe we have already come into contact with them. \n\nLet\u2019s scratch the whole Bermuda Triangle, Dragon Triangle thing, or air pressure leveled bases under water deep within the oceans to which humans can\u2019t reach or even adapt to without exploding internally.\n\nMaybe we have already come into contact with an alien without even knowing it? If you think of all the weird people walking the streets today or even the amount of people on Earth and those who\u2019ve claimed to have been abducted, do you really think they just study us and that\u2019s it? Well when an actor plays a role, before jumping into that role\nThey study it, how they would act, what they would eat or how they would think, what\u2019s their routine like? Aliens not only study us but they definitely have the technology to even BE US. If they can fly faster than the speed of light, and have been hiding essentially for all this time, believe me they have implemented ways to disguise themselves as humans, and maybe not all that good either. Then you ask yourself? Why would they do this? \n\nWell when you hear stories of Aliens coming to you when your sleeping or at weird times of then night, maybe the person that you met that day was in fact an alien and studied you long enough to have come into contact with you and mark where you live. Maybe you fascinated them and they want your story or how you think. Remember, we probably come off as extraordinary to aliens so much like we are fascinated by ANY living microorganisms on ANY other planet we find. \n\nEven though you can learn quite a bit through abducting and probing and running tests, you don\u2019t get a feel for anything about that person other than their body make up, their biology, we gotta think Aliens also study psychology and that would be getting to know us first hand or studying us from a far. This is why they must disguise themselves to interact with a human, cause of all these abduction stories it never begins or ends with the person talking to the alien.\n\nYou might have already come across an alien and haven\u2019t realized it yet. You might have already talked to an alien and haven\u2019t realized it yet. They might have blent so well in with humans, because if they have probed humans and studied humans, maybe they have even tuned into our TV stations from even afar like FBI/CIA can do with phone lines?

One on the forest floor to lye on, and the other tied to the trees above to shelter us from rain. You could see the woods around you, just not the sky above you. The girls had there tarp on one side of camp, and the boys had their tarp on the other side. The counselor's slept in a tent in between the two tarps. It was late in the night, when I woke up because I had to pee. The counselors had left the 'poop bag' out for us in case we had to use the bathroom at night time. So I started to get up, making sure to be quiet because all the girls around me were asleep. However, I didn't make it past my sleeping bag when I saw a man, standing in front of some of the trees. He was watching us. I didn't get a clear look at him, but I remember not being able to see his face fully. He stood there for a while, until he moved and walked away. I just remember thinking if it was a counselor. But now I am sure it was not. That moment still terrifies me to this day, the next morning I told some of my friends about it. One of my friends (I won't give out names) said she saw something similar to that as well. I've ruled out it being trees, it was definitely a man. I kept this story to myself, until I read the story by this one girl called Watcher In The Woods. Who went to St. Georges Camp, a Camp that is also at Shrine Mont. Even though I saw a man and she saw a boy, the fact that we both saw something, just straight up scares me. I'm glad I am not the only one who saw something there. I've been to Shrine Mont a million times since then, and it is an amazing place to visit. I haven't really seen anything out of the ordinary after that moment. I just want to know what I saw. I don't know if I will ever know."}, {"id": "hpd48c", "name": "Yikes, footsteps.", "n_comments": 0, "text": "So I'm not certain of where to post this but I assume this is the place. That and I just really want to get this off my chest because this truly creeped me out.\n\nIn the front of my house, there's the kitchen and the living room while all the rooms are pushed to the back of the house, in a hallway that parts from the living room. Save for my brother's room which is upstairs. The door to the staircase is in the kitchen but that's irrelevant considering he's been on a trip across the country for three days now.\nAnywho, from the kitchen, above the sink, there's no wall and therefore you can see who is leaving and entering the kitchen if it's via hallway. If that makes any sense, it's sorta complicated to explain the layout but I think you get the idea or at least concept.\nSo it was sorta late when it happened. Around 8 at night. I'm in the kitchen, by the stove cooking food. My mom is in her room with my younger siblings which is located at the very end of the hallway. My sister is in her room, the door is closed as always. Basically, I'm the only person in this end of the house. And then so, yeah I'm cooking. \nUp until i hear sudden footsteps behind me. Directly behind me as if they're but a few feet away. And they're stupidly vivid, I can feel the vibrations of them and they're heavy. I could literally feel the floor shaking beneath me, it was that vivid. \nI immeadiately turnt around only to see nothing. I looked around a bit, no one and nothing. Swooped around through the living room and every crevice of the kitchen. I was alone. There were no foosteps down the hall prior to this happening. If it were my mom, she'd enter making some comment of \"What are you burning?\" As she does everytime I'm cooking something. If it were my siblings, they'd run down and if not, I'd definitely hear them. They're absolutely terrible at staying sneaky and quiet and even have their own 'sneak walk'. If it were my sister, which she has stupidly quiet footsteps, I'd hear her door opening (her door is VERY squeaky). And if it was anyone else coming in, all doors were locked so I'd hear them messing with the lock and thus coming in. \nIn short, there's no way it could have been anyone in the house nor anyone who just came in the house.

It felt good to share my experience, so i'll share my last experience I can think of!\n\nIn 2017, My Labrador Harley passed away and, it was probably the hardest pet death iv'e been through. She was my baby, she was my everything, I loved her SO SO much. (I don't want to get into why she passed) and, her death still breaks my heart to this day. A couple nights after she passed, It was about 12 or 1 am and, It was dark in my room and I saw a shadow move out of the corner of my eye and, it was shaped like a dog (for reference she was a black lab) I saw the head and body, I even saw a tail. She was sitting in her favorite spot on the carpet and, I couldn't help but stare at her and, cry because, she was still there, I actually didn't believe she was there. The next night she was still there just looking around, I could visibly see her head move and turn around, her tail wag and, I put the door open for her and, I told her that I loved her and, I went to bed and, after that I didn't see her again, I selfishly wanted her to stay because, I missed her so much and, I wanted more time with her.\n\nFast forward to December of 2019, Our dog Maxwell, I grew up with him, he was a very good boy, a very old boy though about 14 or 15 years old and, he passed away a few days before Christmas and, we had just moved into our new house at the moment and, I was laying in bed and I heard him sniff me or what would have been him sniffing me.

I study in the french system so we basically have two weeks vacations every two months.\nIt all happened during my two weeks vacation of april, during my last year of middle school.\n\nAs the 15 year old teenager that I was, I spent the night watching Netflix, Youtube, checking my social medias and talking to friends. I slept way after the sunrise everyday, like maybe at 6 or 7AM, something like that.\n\nBecause I slept so late and woke up so late too (~5PM) my rhythm was completely fucked up, so I was always washing my face, brushing my teeth and using the bathroom very late at night.\n\nOne night, I went to the bathroom I share with my sister to wash my face before going to sleep. It was around 3AM, and keep in mind I only used the bathroom sink, I did not use the toilet. Right after I finished washing my face and brushing my teeth, I started walking towards the bathroom door to go back to my room when I heard noises coming from my toilet. It sounded very very weird, just like multiple children whispering at the same time. But I wasn\u2019t scared yet and I thought I was making scenarios and that the noise was just a problem with the pipe. So I moved closer to the toilet and approached my ear to the back of the toilet -where all the piping is- only to hear the same thing but louder. I can swear to you that I heard, in the pipes of my toilet, at 3AM, voices of multiple children chatting together quietly and in-distinctively (I didn\u2019t hear any words, just a quiet hubbub.)\n\nI\u2019m muslim, so after experiencing that I just went back to my room and read Quran before falling asleep. I don\u2019t know why but I wasn\u2019t very scared.\n\nLater that day, I told my mom and my sister what happened and they just told me I was paranoid and that it was just water running down or a problem with the pipes. But I knew, and I still know what I heard.\n\nTwo days later, I was taking a shower in the same bathroom (at this point I\u2019ve completely forgotten what had happened) at around midnight I think. When I got out of the shower I looked at myself in the mirror and saw many little red scratches all around my torso and my breasts. They didn\u2019t hurt at all but they were very noticeable, and I -at the time- didn\u2019t have nails long enough to scratch myself that much without noticing it (I even tried to scratch myself to see what it would look like and it did not look like the scratches I had) and it wasn\u2019t caused by hot water because since I\u2019ve been a kid, my grandmother always told me not to use hot water at night (muslim beliefs) so I when I showered at night, I showered with room temperature water.\nOf course, it scared the shit out of me and I rushed to my mom to tell her what had just happened. She reassured me by telling me there must be a logical explanation, but deep down I think she was scared too because she told me to pray, to stop using the bathroom and especially water late at night and to put Quran in my room before going to sleep.\n\nAt this point I was horrified and I used the guests bathroom instead of mine, and I never went there late at night. It lasted a week or so and then I started to use my bathroom again.\nNothing happened for a few days, until one night. It was 9 or 10PM -not very late- and I was in my bathroom, washing my face, brushing my teeth etc... The usual night routine.\nNow as I already said, I share that bathroom with my sister (who has not experienced anything weird in it so far) and that night, she knocked on the bathroom door because she wanted to use it. I told her I was almost done and that she\u2018ll have to wait.\nA few minutes after that I heard a laugh behind the bathroom door, it was kind of a creepy evilish laugh and I asked (through the door) my sister why she was laughing. She did not answer. So I asked again, and she still didn\u2019t respond. I then slammed the door open, and there was no one there. I went to the living room only to find my sister talking with my mother, with the TV turned off. I started shouting at my sister and telling her that she wasn\u2019t funny, that she knew I was scared of that bathroom and that her prank was just dumb and mean (I really thought she was pranking me).\nShe did not even understand what I was talking about, and same for my mom. So I explained to them what just happened and they both swore it wasn\u2019t them.\nThey looked scared and until this day there is no logical explanation for that laugh : my phone was in my bedroom and there wasn\u2019t any video playing on it (even if it did, I couldn\u2019t hear it from the bathroom), the living room TV was turned off and my mom and sister were talking and not laughing (and once again I wouldn\u2019t have heard the laugh if it came from the living room).\n\nAs I said this happened a few years ago, and since that time nothing else happened in that bathroom, except three days ago -and this is what made me want to post about my story on reddit.\nMy sister wanted to take a shower late at night (midnight), and when she entered the bathroom she saw our cat in it, growling at nothing. My sister told me about it, went back to her room, and waited for the next morning to shower...\n\nThank you for reading, I tried my best so I really hope there\u2019s no mistakes."}, {"id": "hosctv", "name": "My Sisters Haunted Apartment / Mysterious Caller", "n_comments": 35, "text": "My sister lives all day alone in a Apartment.

He has no facial features at all, no hair or clothes. He is permanently standing in something very close to the yoga \"mountain pose\" but with his hands sticking parallel to the floor and his shoulders slightly hunched as if he's leaning forward a little. He is a deep, deep black color. He's prominently black, even if I see him in a dark room, Like Vantablack. He never speaks, and never makes any other sort of movement but if I were to try and move around him, he sort of....pivots so he is ALWAYS facing me. Not that moving around him is easy; he always stands in the corner of the room, but if I were to move from one opposite corner to the other, he will pivot without moving to watch me.  He looks *eerie*. Unnatural.\n\nThe first time I saw him when I was 15, he was just...there one day in my parents' house, Mid-afternoon on a perfectly normal day in the middle of the UK. I screamed the house down and ran out of the room to fetch my brother, and when I returned, he was still there. My brother could not see him. No one has ever seen him but me. Ever since then (I'm 32 now), He just...shows up with no determinable trigger. Daytime, night time, when I'm around other people.. I've moved to other houses, seen him in other places. He's just always THERE when he feels like it and leaves when he feels like it. He just stops being there. \n\nI do not tend to feel anything overwhelmingly negative when he is around other than a chill of nerves, but nothing positive either. He's just... There, and he looks freaky. In an attempt to make myself feel better about him constantly showing up, I named him Frank, simply because it was an innocuous name to give to him. I speak to him sometimes, but I never get any sort of response. I must say, I do get pretty nervous with him just being there, but honestly, I think that is mostly because I have literally no idea who or what he might be. When he first arrived, it was fairly terrifying. Nowadays I suppose I am rather used to him. \n\nI'd love to know what he is...or how to make contact. I think if he did ANYTHING at all, it would make me feel a little better, but he just stands there when he shows up and then just gone. Always watching ....if not for the fact he has no face. If he's here to watch over me, is there any way I could give him a thank you? Or if he isn't... How do I get him to move on?

We would often see him muttering something to himself or staring at someone in a weird way.

This story takes place on an October night in 2005. We had gathered at my Dad's house for a party. He lived way out in the country, in an old farmhouse. We decided to drive up the road to an old cemetary, because one of my friends showed up with a Ouiji board. I said we weren't going to use it at my house, but I was game to use it somewhere else. About 6 of us piled in to vehicles and took off. When we got there, we set the Ouiji board up on an old Concrete barrier that surrounded the entrance of the cemetery. For context, the cemetary was set on a hill, surrounded by cow pastures, fields, and trees. A crossed the road stood an old, white church. There were 2 security lights that lit the church area and the entrance to the cemetary. There was one more security light that lit the field, next to the only house for about 2 miles. We all stood in a circle, planchette in the centers, hands on it. My friend let the seance and asked if there was anything in the cemetary with us. At first nothing happened and we all stood still and quiet. Then the planchette slowly moved towards Yes. Immediately, we all started accusing each other of moving it, but everyone swore they didn't.  An eerie feeling fell over us, as the planchette moved back to the center of the board. About that time we heard what sounded like wind at first, but then began to get closer. It sounded like footsteps of multiple people running in circles all around us. We were all wide eyed, looking at each other, when someone said I'm out! Another person said \"we have to tell it bye, or the spirits will follow!\" The leader of the group spoke to the board and said something along the lines of \"We are saying goodbye to you\" and the planchette quickly jerked to No. It was pretty obvious by how shocked we all were that none of us had done that. Mind you, the sound of the footsteps are still surrounding us. The planchette moves to the center and we say Bye again. Again, it moves to No, then back to the center. This time we all say together (my friends idea) \"Goodbye! We are leaving\" and it slowly, agonizing slowly, moved to Goodbye. We were relieved and took off running to the cars, which were parked at the entrance on the cemetary side of the road. Me and a buddy jump in my truck and I hear my friend scream \"Guys, I cant find me keys!\" She checks the ignition, her pockets, all our friends check the car and their pockets-No keys. Everyone else loads back into the truck and we speed the 3 miles down the road to my Dads house. My friend searches her purse and pockets for the keys again and we couldnt find them anywhere. Eventually, someone takes her home and she says she will get her spare set and get a ride back to her car in the morning. We were all too scared to go back and look that night. The next day my friend searches the cemetary and never find the keys, even in broad daylight. We hadn't walked around a whole lot and where we used the Ouiji board was very close to where we parked our cars. Me and several friends scoured the entire cemetary over the next week or so and never found the keys. My friend said she was 100% positive they were left in the ignition when she got out of the car. It's where I left mine and a common practice in the area I am from, which like I said, is pretty rural. This was by far my scariest, but not the only, Ouiji experience I have.

He had his iPhone on the desk and I was giving my thoughts on how we should go about the rest of the shift, and as I was speaking his phone made an noise so we both looked down at his phone and Siri popped up and it said that we said \u201cHey Siri, we are dead and then Siri spoke and said I could not find we are dead in your playlist.\u201d Now mind you that his Siri is set up by voice and only his voice could make Siri pop up on his phone and when it did I was the one talking. Kind of odd, creepy, but yet very interesting."}, {"id": "hp6rqe", "name": "Having some more strangeness tonight", "n_comments": 2, "text": "So, I recently posted about an orb of light I observed last week in my bedroom, and it\u2019s been quiet since then, until tonight. No orbs or anything this time, but there have been a few odd occurences I thought were worth mentioning.\n\nMy wife and I were watching TV in our upstairs bedroom a couple of hours ago when we heard an abnormal crash/bang downstairs. I promptly got up and snuck a look over the half-wall at the top of the stairs and didn\u2019t see anything. Then I heard the doggy door. My initial thought was that it was one of our two cats since I know they like to go on adventures sometimes, but when I looked down at the cat tower at the bottom of the staircase they were both snug in their beds. I was fairly spooked, but I knew I had to go down there and check it out.\n\nI walked very slow and quiet, listening for any more noises along the way. I made it down the stairs and through the hall towards the living room and turned on all of the lights. In that moment the sprinkler system went off in the back yard, which I figured was just an odd coincidence, so I continued walking through the living room into the kitchen scanning for anything out of place. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until I noticed the door to the pantry was wide open. This creeped me out - I had just been down in the kitchen half an hour earlier to get some tapioca from the fridge, and I am entirely sure that door was all the way closed. I shut the door, and looked around in slightly more of a panic. \n\nI went over to check the back yard through the blinds and I didn\u2019t see anything unusual, though the motion sensor lights were on. I chalked that one up to the sprinklers coming on since I didn\u2019t see or hear anything else out there. After another quiet minute I turned out the lights and went back upstairs without any answers.\n\nFast forward 45 minutes from that point, my wife had just gone to sleep. All of a sudden I started to feel like the bed was moving under me for a second. It was like there was something beneath it pushing up on the frame right under me. Our dog was moving around trying to get comfortable in that moment, so I thought it was plausible that it was a ripple from him plopping down and I was still just a little creeped out from earlier.\n\n15 minutes before I started writing this, it happened again, this time for a few seconds longer. I thought it might be one of our animals under the bed, grooming or whatever. I saw doggo was still at the foot of the bed, now fast asleep, but I didn\u2019t see the cat (she\u2019s a different cat from the two down stairs, this one likes to sleep in our room.) I pulled out my flashlight app to see where she was, and I saw her passed out in her bed under the TV. This is when I actually started to panic.\n\nI don\u2019t want to believe there\u2019s something in our room messing with us, so I\u2019ve been looking for any way to rationalize it. I began looking online for any blips on the richter scale. I knew an earthquake was a far-fetched scenario where we live in Texas. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and in 35 years I have never felt a single one, though with how this year has been nothing would surprise me. I checked a few sources - everything looked quiet, and I was out of ideas.\n\nI\u2019m too afraid to look under the bed right now, and the only thing I could think to do was come here and write about it. <- As I was typing this sentence I heard a loud noise from the ceiling right above where I had seen the orb last week. It sounded like someone dropped a bolt onto the ceiling from the attic. I know that\u2019s not possible since there\u2019s insulation, so maybe it was just your average creak in a house, even if it was at least twice as loud as I\u2019ve heard anything like that while living here.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get any sleep; something has felt slightly off all night and I have a serious case of the heebie-geebies."}, {"id": "hot4fi", "name": "woke up at 4am to a man in my room staring at me", "n_comments": 19, "text": "this past night, I woke up at 4am and saw this man next to my bed staring at me. \n\nwhen I go to bed, I bring my desk chair next to my bed and put my laptop on it to watch youtube (so the laptop doesn\u2019t fall off my bed). i guess I fell asleep with a video playing. \n\nlater, I remember opening my eyes and instantly seeing a man with shoulder length dark hair next to the chair staring at me. his eyes were huge and I remember either his eyes or his whole body shaking? the same youtuber that I was watching when I fell asleep was on but it was a different video, and I could hear the audio perfectly. he was only there for a few seconds. \n\ni don\u2019t remember what happened in between these things, but i next remember turning on my phone and seeing that it was 4:35am, and a different video from the same youtuber was still playing on my laptop. for whatever reason, I went on tik tok for like half an hour and didn\u2019t think much of what just happened. then at like 5, I put my phone down and tried falling asleep to the YouTube video. \n\nit might just be sleep paralysis, but I can\u2019t remember if I moved or not when I saw the man. I can\u2019t stop thinking about this experience. if anyone can confirm it was sleep paralysis or not, thank would be nice lol thanks"}, {"id": "hp0vt8", "name": "Non-cat non-encounter in the snowy dark", "n_comments": 30, "text": "A few winters ago, there was, as there always is, a snowstorm. I live near the edge of a small town on the prairie in South Dakota. It was late at night, quiet, no one else around. I was outside to take the trash out. It was windy, the snow was blowing, but visibility was decent and it was bright due to the snow. This is all to say I should have seen the cat. \n\nI heard it, meowing sadly just behind the dumpster enclosure. I of course went to look because a cat out in this wouldn't last the night. The cat was not there, but I heard the meow again, a little further away, in the empty parking lot. I got closer but the sound stayed the same distance away. Concerned for the well-being of this cat, I kept following the sound across the snow. I should have seen the cat. The meow was right there, but there was no cat. \n\nI ended up by the row of trees bordering the fields behind the last building. The meow was now coming from within the darkness of those trees. I stopped, the hair on the back of my neck standing up, and got the hell out of there. There were no tracks, though the sound had been in front of me the whole time.

Whilst in the movie my cousins younger brother falls asleep and we made sure he was asleep because we tried joking with him but found him snoring. Later in the day almost 12 hours later were talking and my cousins younger brother starts talking about how the movie we watched after was really cool me and my cousin instantly looked at each other like what the fuck. We told him he was asleep but he says he remembers vividly being there even describing scenes of the movie. When we told him he was definetly asleep he said he was sitting right behind his older brother at this point we were creeped out because behind the older brother was a wall.
