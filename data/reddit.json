Bigfoot: Bigfoot could be a surviving genus of [Gigantopithecus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantopithecus). They fit nearly the exact description of what that animal does and if Crocodiles, Alligators and Sharks have survived from the prehistoric ages until now, it\u2019s entirely possible this species did as well. \n\n2. Ghosts: There are many videos you can find online of paranormal investigations that yield results inexplicable by science or logic. Sure, there are definitely a lot of videos out there faked for views but there\u2019s a lot of videos coming from perfectly sane, honest people who have nothing to gain from lying or faking it. Not only that, a quick google search will bring up thousands of articles and videos about ancient society\u2019s depicting their ghost encounters so this is hardly a new phenomenon.  \n\n\n3. Aliens: Regardless of your religious views or beliefs  on how the universe was made we know that it\u2019s infinitely expanding and there are trillions of planets and many *many* galaxies. Just based on probability alone, it\u2019s highly unlikely that in all that space earth is the only planet that holds life. \n\nMy final and most important point that all these creatures have in common, is there\u2019s millions of reports of encounters with these creatures worldwide every year. Some of which are likely to be fake, others might be mis-sightings and can be explained by science but there are bound to be a lot that aren\u2019t fake and inexplicable by science and come from honest, sane people. Based on the volume of the reports alone they can\u2019t *all* be fake.

I would be working around Ang Mo Kio Ave 9 and have heard that it is an 'industrial area'. So, where should I live so that the commute isn't much of a headache and there's all the basic amenities around. I have gone through propertyguru and omh websites but I just cannot pinpoint the area I want to live in. Budget would be anywhere between 750 - 900 S$ for a single occupancy furnished room. Also, I need to get a temporary accomodation when I get there, so is there any other option other than AirBnb? \n\nSecond, what is the best way to bring in cash? I was thinking of getting a temporary Forex card but the charges seem too steep. I just don't want to lose money because of exorbitant airport forex rates.\n\nThird, hangout spots! I am a huge food and I love exploring the local cuisine and prefer to live like a local. Please list down your favorite places where you like to eat and I would make sure I check it out. \n\nI had so many questions when I was preparing to write this post but now I am blanking out. But thanks in advance for all your suggestions!

I'll start with what my view **isn't**, and then get to the essence of what it is.\n\nFirst, it is absolutely not my view that recreational drug use should be normalized within society, or that it is (or is not) moral on an individual level.\n\nSecondly, I'm not at all advocating for the legalization of crimes that typically accompany drug possession (with the exception of possession of drug paraphernalia). Most notably, I absolutely believe DUI/DWI should remain a crime, no matter the mind-altering substance involved.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, I am not at all advocating for the legalization of current black-market drugs. Instead, I would propose a system where the government, with strict regulatory oversight, allows private companies to manufacture and distribute the drugs. This would look something like current government oversight in the alcohol, tobacco, and legal marijuana markets.\n\nTo keep this post a manageable length, I'm going to skip-over some of the arguments I find somewhat-to-quite persuasive and cut right to the main point. Before I do, however, I think it's worth mentioning that (in no particular order) libertarian-styled freedom of choice type arguments, criminal justice system reform arguments and racial justice arguments all factor into my opinion.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'm looking at this problem from a harm-reduction standpoint. Not necessarily harm-reduction to the individual (although that argument could absolutely be made), but rather harm-reduction to all of society. Admittedly it feels a little uncomfortable to say, in effect, \"Legalize all drugs to fix our social problems!!!\" (hence the post on CMV), but I honestly think the logic holds.\n\nFirst of all, I think the last 50 years or so of the \"War on Drugs\" has proven that no matter how many resources we dedicate to eliminating drug use/abuse, we can never really get rid of it. From my point of view, no progress at all has been made on reducing drug use over the past 50 years, despite the vast increase in resources invested to that end. (I might go even further and say that drug abuse is a bigger problem now as compared to the past several decades.) Did we not learn our lesson with Prohibition?\n\nSo, since drug abuse is not a problem that can be solved (or even improved) through enforcement, why bother? Why continue pouring resources (tax dollars, man-hours, etc.) into a futile effort?\n\nThat brings me to my next point. It's not just a futile effort, it's actual quite harmful. Beyond even the obvious harms of mass-incarceration and giving to police another tool to racially discriminate, I would argue that enforcement of drug laws is harmful to all of society.\n\nFor example, think about all the other crimes people tend to associate with drug abuse. Petty theft, larceny, burglary, conspiracy, child neglect... the list goes on. What do all of these crimes have in common? They're all crimes committed by people who need money. They need money to fund their drug habit, of course, but also to put food on the table and a roof over their heads.\n\nSo... just stop doing drugs, right? Yes and no. Yes, that would solve the problem, but it's not that simple. Drug addiction literally hardwires the brain to seek out that drug more than anything else. More than food, more than water, more than shelter. So, when the paycheck comes in, it's not food that gets purchased first. It's more drugs.\n\nAlright, but what does that have to do with legalizing drugs? It all comes down to why drugs are so expensive in the first place. After all, it wouldn't be such a major problem for an addict to purchase drugs before food if there was still money left over to buy the food after having bought the drugs. And the short answer to why drugs are so expensive is that by making them illegal, we, in effect, give criminal organizations and street gangs a monopoly on them. Less competition = higher prices. It's that simple.\n\nThis post is getting pretty long, so I'm going to cut it off here, but I'd be happy to clarify/add additional info if requested."}, {"id": "ibjjqp", "n_comments": 78, "name": "CMV: \u201cBlack Lives Matter Too\u201d would be more universally accepted than \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d", "text": "When I first heard of BLM ~4-5 years ago, I was in high school and frankly not very knowedgeable about social issues.

What qualities, thoughts, wishes can he be thinking that can't be turned around with \"so a guy with those same qualities is acting like a girl?\". Either social characteristics can have assigned genders, or they can't.

Now, it's still used with that meaning, but, much more commonly it's used synonymously with \"bad\". E.g \"that movie is shit!\" or \"you smell like shit!\". The latter sentence isn't necessarily saying someone spells like poop, they're saying they have an unpleasant smell.\n\nOkay, now, let's look at a slur, since that's what you're calling it. The N-word. I'm not black, and out of respect to black people I won't say it. We all know it's racist origins at this point, where white people used it as a derogatory term to black people. But, nowadays, it's seen as something only black people can say and it's more of just a way to refer to a person. I have friends with all different types of races, but my black friends don't ONLY use it when referring to a black person. They use it when talking about anyone. Sure, sounds a bit weird, but this is way more common, since, I've heard it a LOT, at least here in Europe.\n\nYes, it's seen as racist when a white person says it, thanks to how people see the word now.\n\nThe word retard did a reverse n-word. Started off seen as offensive, but now, most people will agree that it's not really offensive. Dumbass, idiot, imbecile, stupid, retard. They're used interchangeably now. The roots of a word don't define how it's used now, take the n-word for example.\n\nIt's not even as severe of an insult as you make it sound, since, people don't really get offended by it. I don't mean to be rude to you, but honestly, you're just being illogical. I won't comment on the word faggot or trap since I don't know much about either and my point still stands without those two specific examples.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, no one uses retard as a slur nowadays."}, {"id": "ibu1ei", "n_comments": 2, "name": "CMV: What and how schools teach as \"being safe online\" is 99% of the time either: complete bullshit or common sense.

Obviously, it's good social media has age restrictions, but, personally, it's more about the child's maturity.

Combine those 2 ideas results in consciousness being a immaterial thing that exists.\n\nI see no reason why our current inability to measure, or imagine a way to measure, consciousness leads to the conclusion that it is unmeasurable.  Consciousness is extremely complicated and it seems much more reasonable to attribute this lack of measurable-ness more to our own limitations rather than assume that something we don't understand must be immaterial.\n\n*We can't explain consciousnesses therefore there exists in the universe immaterial things* seems like the exact same jump people make when they say \"science can't explain X, therefore God did it\".

I don't want go get too deep in the general debate, but I think the entire debate can and should be boiled down to one simple idea, \"When does life begin?\". Now, I know this question has been mentioned in the debate, but in my eyes the debate revolves almost entirely around this question. Let me explain.  Most \"Pro-Choice\" advocates are surely not behind the idea of very-late-term abortions, like 8 or 9 months. I'm sure to most people that would be considered \"murder\".  Likewise, to most \"Pro-Life\" advocates, birth control is not considered murder.  There will be extremists on both sides that do not fall into these categories, but by and large I think the large majority of the people would fit into these criteria.  That means, the only things that separates these pro-life and pro-choice sides is \"where does life begin?\" Taken one step further, it's not really that one side is \"for life\" and the other is \"for choice\".  It's much more accurate to say that one side believes that life begins in early pregnancy and the other believes that life begins later in the pregnancy. I'm not sure how you would describe that in simple terms, but I believe that saying \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" just creates a larger division between the two sides, because the antonyms of these terms would be \"pro-murder\" and \"pro-slavery\" or something along those lines. Neither side wants to be called a murderer or a slave driver.  So, to wrap it up, we need better terms than \"Pro-Life\" and \"Pro-Choice\"  \n\nThings that would change my view would be a reasonable explanation of why these terms are actually accurate, why these terms aren't actually harmful, or why these terms are better than the alternatives.  CMV\n\n\n**Edit:** My immediate suggestions for better terms would be something like \"Early Life\" (Pro-Life) vs \"Late Life\" (Pro-Choice). It doesn't demonize either side and I think it more accurately portrays the beliefs of the 2 sides. Those terms are not a hill I'm willing to die on. There may be better terms, I won't deny that, and I'd rather not debate why those terms miss the mark. I do think they are better terms than \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice\" though.\n\nAlso, I think u/BingBongTheArtcher was correct in his response that these terms are used intentionally to hurt the other side of the debate. It's the same tactic that is used throughout politics. It is meant to elicit an emotional response. As I replied to them, this adds fuel to the argument that the terms are not objective and should be changed to something more accurate if we want to keep an open mind and have an objective discussion about the topic. Unfortunately, openness and objectivity don't seem to be at the forefront of political discourse and thus, we are left with these terms demonizing the other side."}, {"id": "iblf5a", "n_comments": 67, "name": "CMV: absolutely noone deserves to die (via death penalty, revenge or other means), no matter the person they are/ have been", "text": "This is something that has irritated me forever, and since I\u2018m on reddit this just got worse. Whenever I stumble uppon a post about something terrible, people in the comments are always verry vocative about the culprit being killed, mutilated, having the same done to their loved ones or similar. That\u2018s usually the part where I turn off and do something else, since open and directed hate just is something I can\u2018t quite grasp and try to distance myself from.\n\nAbout the matter; Since I think this should be said as early as possible: **I DO NOT SUPPORT OR CONDONE ANY FORM OF SUPPRESSION, HATE CRIME, MURDER, MUTILATION, RAPE OR OTHER FORM OF PHYSICAL OR MENTAL TORTURE AND INJURY. I THINK THOSE ARE AGAINST WHAT WE, AS HUMANS CONSIDDER UNIVERSAL RIGHTS AND SHOULD NEVER BE PERPETRATED.** I want to make absolutely clear that even if it might *seem to some people that my argumentation is lean or forgiving towards criminals, it is absolutely not the case.* I just don\u2018t support the idea of killing someone.\n\nNow the main part: I don\u2018t think killing someone over their actions is a real solution to a crime. I\u2018m a strong opponent to the death penalty, because it just operates as a form of revenge in my opponion. It should work as some form of warning towards possible criminals, but evidently it doesn\u2018t. Those crimes happen anyways, in countries with and without the death penalty. Criminals don\u2018t just stop their intentions and desires because they fear being killed in repercussion, they just argue that \u201ethey won\u2018t be caught since they\u2018re thorough and do it quietly\u201c. Killing a criminal just acts as an offering to the hungry mob that is the public, like killing a goat as an offering to your god so he won\u2018t strike you in vengeance and be pleased with your doings.\n\nPeople might argue that this would be different if something similar would happen to me or someone I hold dear, but I\u2018ve already made up my mind about this situation and, even then, would not support the murder of another person, even if it would be executed on legal grounds. Even if I would be raped or mutilated beyond recognition and harmed in a way that I find my own life not worth living anymore, I would not condone the killing of another human being. I don\u2019t think I, or any other person for that matter should be able to decide who is alowed to live anymore and who isn\u2018t expect the person themself. I don\u2018t think anyone should ever be forced to do or endure something they are not comfortable with and think might impact their own standart of living in any lasting way. In my oppinion, this falls exactly into what the quote \u201eEye for an eye and the world goes blind\u201c describes; murder as punishment for murder leads to nothing exept another body to burry.\n\nThe big question with my mindset is what to do with the murderer/ rapist/ whatever. Being locked up and having the public to pay for their survival with a secured roof over their head and meal every day is something that just seems illogical to me, even though it is the only option, since just letting them walk free isn\u2018t an option. So I\u2018ll have to go into some kind of \u201eutopian worldview\u201c so to speak. I know it isn\u2018t possible, but in the same vein as the best solution would be that people just stop commiting crimes, the best solution for criminals would just be to send them somewhere off to an island. If someone shows indisputable signs of unwillingness to function in a society and no signs of bettering themselfes, they should just not be alowed to stay in said society. But if they do show any form of remorse and will to better themselfes, they should be given the chance via therapy and mental help. They shouldn\u2018t be killed and thus forcefully be removed from it, but rather be given the chance to try and survive on their own, without someone else having to support them im their survival.\n\nIf those criminals then form a new kind of society, so be it. If those criminals choose to kill each other, so be it. If they show clearly no remorse over their actions and no will to better themselfes, they should not be entitled to help by people that want to function in their society. But if you call out for someone to be killed over their deeds, you should be willing to do it yourselfe. And if you *are* willing to do it yourself, you\u2018re not better of a human being than the criminal in the first place.\n\nEdit: Since it has been pointed out to me by /u/seasonalblah that the caption might be misleading; I\u2018d like to add *absolutely noone deserves to die [against their will]*."}, {"id": "ib3a6x", "n_comments": 151, "name": "CMV: You Shouldn't Have Children If You Can't Afford Them.", "text": "Look...

These two sorts of school are places which essentially select children on either economic or religious grounds. Private (fee-paying) schools draw an intake from disproportionately middle and upper class families, and they pretty much just draw a little fence around all the children from well-off families, so middle-class parents can make sure little Timothy never has to associate with working class 'riff-raff' whose parents can't afford to send their kids there.\n\nFaith schools segregate on the basis of ideology, which is a very strange concept if you think about it, since I seriously doubt the British people would accept the existence of a state-funded 'Marxist school' or 'libertarian school' (and rightly so), but apparently a 'Catholic school' or an 'Islamic school' is acceptable. Unlike private schools, faith schools do at least make it possible for students to join who are not from that particular in-group (since it's not like you have to pass some kind of faith test to enter) but the point still stands that since obviously Catholic parents will be more inclined to send their offspring to a Catholic school than non-Catholic parents the result is that these schools still create divisions on religious grounds among the student body. And on racial grounds as well, since religion is often tied up with race.\n\nThere are other forms of segregated schools in the UK: gendered schools and grammar schools, but in the interest of brevity I'll keep my focus on the two above-mentioned school types.\n\nMy view:\n\n**The idea of raising children in ideological or economic bubbles is wrong** for two reasons:\n\n1. It means that the child is being given an ideological identity by their parents rather than being left to form it for themselves. They may obviously go on to rebel against this identity, but many will accept it as part of who they are and it may take years to shake, if it ever does. All parents will instil their ideology (religious, political or otherwise) into their offspring at home, and that's unavoidable, but the point of secular state schools is that these are more neutral spaces where a range of different ideological influences will be presented to the child and they have more autonomy to forge their own path, which may be different from their parents', or may be the same. If the ideology of the school is just an echo of the ideology of the parents then the child is being deprived of opportunities to be their own person during their formative years.\n2. I believe that social integration is intrinsically a good thing and that social segregation is intrinsically a bad thing. It's good to grow up with people from different backgrounds to your own. It fosters empathy for those we share this country with and broadens social experience. How much empathy do the privately educated Tory party have for the working class, for example? Why did it take a footballer campaigning for weeks to convince them to provide free school meals for impoverished families over the summer during during the recent lockdown? In the UK our most popular newspapers (the Mail, Express and Sun) are all adept at whipping up fear of 'the other', whether this is immigrants, gay people or the poor. The reason they are so successful at this is that we all live in class, race, religious and ideological bubbles: we surround ourselves with people who are like us and have views like us, sometimes through choice and sometimes not. And to some extent this is a big part of adult life and is exacerbated by things like social media, geography and work. But schools are at least places where we could - in theory - try very hard not to create these bubbles, and instead embrace plurality and diversity. Even if the rest of society contains 'bubbles', we *don't have to* make schools into bubbles.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe government makes it a law that all state schools must espouse a bunch of specific tenets which it calls \"British values\" (which are really liberal democratic values and many teachers hate the jingoistic name, but that's another matter). Many of these values are centred around diversity. It's all very well getting teachers to tell their tutorial classes that diversity is a good thing, but how can we really claim, as a country, to value diversity when we support social segregation of children on the grounds of class, religion and (by proxy, through religion) race?"}, {"id": "ibsav9", "n_comments": 18, "name": "CMV: voting for the president is pointless", "text": "The reason I feel this way is because of the electoral college.

For example, if  you are an Evangelical Christian who believes abortion to be an  outrageous murder of an unborn child what does it matter to you if the  party who will stop that deregulates environmental protections and  provides huge tax benefits for multinationals?\n\nIf  you are climate fighter and want to save the planet from global warming  then does it matter if the Democrats secretly gain millions from super  PACs to quietly bring in legislation that will continue to benefit  multinationals and the richest percentage of people?\n\nThis  goes down to identity politics and how this is used in all aspects of  culture. From popular to upper class. This focus is always about gender,  race or some form of identity. If you really want to stop racism there  need to be a systematic shift in the views of what causes it.\n\nIf  you were rich one of the best ways to keep you power and wealth would  be to point the white man at an illegal immigrant and say \"he's taking  your job\" while busting his union, lowering his wages and shifting his  job offshore. Then he will not blame you, he will blame the immigrant.  At the same time point the black person to the white person and say, \"he  enslaved your ancestors and hates you because of the colour of your  skin\". While, in reality, he did no such thing and has no control over  what his ancestors did except for trying to make reparations for what  happened (which by the way should be the job of the upper class).\n\nWhen  women pit themselves against men, when men deligitimise women when  races divide and go against each other nothing changes. When people call  for radical change and huge differences in the status quo it plays into  the upper classes\u2019 hands because it's so far from reality.\n\nWhat  needs to happen is a systematic rebalancing of the priorities of  western democracy. Real everyday changes that could be achieved with  enough political will. Things such as publicly funded elections,  compulsory voting, protections for unions against corporation\u2019s union  busting efforts, independent electoral commissions, established  anti-corruption hearings, banning of donations to political parties,  real minimum wage growth and access to affordable housing.\n\nThe  long-term goal of these is to retake some of the power the upper class  and corporations have been gaining for the last four decades. To  redistribute some of that wealth and give it to people in a fair and  egalitarian way. This all ties into corporations also controlling the  media and the worship of celebrities but that is a rant for another  time.\n\nThese are not pipe dreams.  They are ridiculed by the monopolistic media and branded with words by  politicians bought and paid for. Instead of dividing by branding  ourselves as a certain race, sexuality or gender we shoud be focusing  how to distribute the abundent resources fairly so all people have the  ability to live fullfilling lives. We can do it with sensible reform to a  magnificent achievment in human history that is Western Democracies and  Capitalist Societies."}, {"id": "ibnezl", "n_comments": 18, "name": "cmv: Total abstinence is dangerous for many alcoholics with a psychological addiction", "text": "Having a black and white approach to drinking is dangerous because it puts immense mental pressure on the individual staying sober.

Everyone can also be emotional, weak and dependent, these aren't \"female\" traits. However individuals vary a lot in their personalities and capacities. So everyone needs to have the same opportunities in life to make the most they can out of it\n\n**Modern feminist message** : masculinity falsely promotes rationality, stoicism and independence as traits worth striving for. They are actually often bad for you and toxic in their manifestation. Feminine traits like emotional intelligence, vulnerability and ability to cooperate and turn to others for support are healthy traits that should be embraced and promoted by society. \n\n\nThis translates into the common complaint that female characters with \"masculine\" traits are actually anti feminist, calls for more emphasis put on femininity etc.\n\nObligatory \"as a woman\", this annoys the hell out of me.\n\nStereotypes are stereotypes. Feminine traits and femininity is not some yin or yang to masculine, it's literally the traits given to people of limited social power and influence.

No reasonable and informed person could believe otherwise.", "text": "In particular, I'm hoping that you can help me change the second part of this view.  I honestly can't even begin to understand the opposite viewpoint, so I'd like to be able to at least see how a reasonable person can get to this conclusion without relying on wishful thinking or conspiracy theories.\n\nI apologize that this will be a somewhat longer post laying out my view, but I hope you'll stick with me.\n\nThe basic facts of the case:\n\n* Snowden stole [1.5 million](https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_rpt/hpsci-snowden.pdf) classified documents from the U.S. government.  The vast majority of these were military documents.  Snowden has publicly disclosed a few thousand of these documents.\n* If Snowden's intentions purely involved whistle-blowing on civil liberties issues, there was absolutely no reason for him to steal classified military documents, documents unrelated to civil liberties issues, or such a large volume of documents generally.\n* In preparation for his disclosures, Snowden flew to China (Hong Kong).  Snowden has claimed he planned to remain in Hong Kong on the basis of its strong record on free speech issues.  Hong Kong is not known for a strong record on free speech.  However, China is well-known as the country in the world that would be most interested in purchasing classified US military documents.\n* After leaving China, Snowden flew to Russia.  He has claimed that he was en route to Latin America, but there's no way of verifying this.  Russia, like China, is a country that would highly interested in purchasing classified US military documents and is otherwise a weird destination for someone claiming to be interested in protecting civil liberties.\n* Snowden has since remained in Russia, living in peace.  Russia could have traded Snowden to the United States for other things of value, but has instead allowed him to live in the country.  They are not doing this out of the goodness of their hearts, and the only plausible explanation for their willingness to host Snowden is that he is providing them with some kind of benefit.  Snowden initially had some propaganda value, but this has faded over time.\n* Even if we assume that Snowden went to Moscow with pure motives, the Russian security services (who are not constrained by rule of law/democracy/etc) would certainly have attempted to threaten Snowden into giving them classified information (\"You can stay, but only if you give us information on X,Y,Z\"; \"Give us information on X,Y,Z or you're going to have an accident and fall down a flight of stairs.\")  There would be no reason for the FSB not to harm Snowden if he refused such an offer.\n\nThe perspectives I've heard from Snowden's defenders are that:\n\n1. He fled to Russia/China because they would protect him from the US\n2. He took the military documents as \"insurance\"\n3. He would be living more opulently in Russia if he was cooperative with their security services.\n\nLet me take these in turn.  On #1, Snowden could have fled to anywhere in Europe other than the UK and he would have had strong legal protection under the political offense exception to extradition.  European courts have refused to allow the extradition of even terrorist masterminds under the political offense exception and, unless Snowden engaged in additional misconduct, his offense was of a political nature.  Snowden's protection in Russia is purely political and could disappear at any time, whereas these legal protections would be enduring.  There are many places to live in Europe that are more pleasant than Moscow.  The only downside is that you can't sell secrets to the Russians while living in these places.\n\nOn #2, this is what Snowden's partner Glenn Greenwald [has said](https://theweek.com/articles/462192/edward-snowden-blackmailing-america):\n\n>He has already distributed thousands of documents and made sure that various people around the world have his complete archive. If something happens to him, these documents would be made public. This is his insurance policy. The U.S. government should be on its knees everyday praying that nothing happens to Snowden, because if anything should happen, all the information will be revealed and this would be its worst nightmare.\n\nAt a minimum, Snowden's willingness to blackmail the United States government shows he's willing to trade national security for personal gain.  If Snowden was willing to use the documents in this way, then I don't follow the argument that he wouldn't sell at least some of them to the Russians to make his life there more comfortable.  I agree that he might not sell all of them, giving continuing insurance against both sides, but it logically follows that a blackmailer would be willing to sell some portion of the documents.\n\nOn #3, Snowden can only preserve his public image by pretending not to have sold documents to Russia, so he can't openly live in opulence.  What he does out of view of the Western media is anyone's guess.  Beyond that,  history does not support the idea that he would be rewarded with an opulent life.  Kim Philby, perhaps the greatest spy for Russia of all time, lived an unhappy life, attempted suicide, and eventually drank himself to death after defecting to Moscow.  There's no reason to suppose Snowden would be rewarded with a Porsche and a palace.\n\nI don't think you can change my mind about Snowden, so as I said, this is mostly focused on whether or not a reasonable and informed person could hold the opposite view.\n\nQuick Edit: I would consider holding or expressing the opposite view for ideological reasons as a form of unreasonableness.  I'm well aware that some people, who are otherwise reasonable and informed, are inclined to take the most favorable view of Snowden for ideological reasons.\n\nSubsequent Edit, doubling as a sort of TL;DR: I think the easiest way to change my view is to provide some alternative explanation that makes sense and explains Snowden's behavior.  In particular, the two core facts that: 1) Snowden mostly took military documents unrelated to civil liberties; 2) Snowden went to China then Russia when he would have been safe from extradition in any European country of his choosing other than UK; and 2.5) Aside from intent to sell classified documents to Russia/China, there was no reason to go to these countries rather than than a European country given both overall quality of life and Snowden's avowed concern for civil liberties."}, {"id": "ib281q", "n_comments": 318, "name": "CMV: The people crying out for protest for the 5 year old kid who was murdered are delusional.", "text": "  It's obviously tragic, no one is denying.

I am not here to debate that. I am here to debate Korea.\n\nThere are usually three main arguments which people give with regards to how US intervention in Vietnam was unjust: \n\n1. The numerous Vietnamese dictators that the US propped up were ruthless, authoritarian murderers (i.e. Phoenix Program) and were no better than the communists they were fighting.\n2. The US absolutely obliterated the area (Agent Orange) and committed a plethora of war crimes, which probably left the country in a state no better off than when the US first entered.\n3. Thousands of men were called up from Selective Service to die in a jungle which they had nothing to gain from. The US should have just stayed out of it as civil war was inevitable.\n\nThe thing is, these things can be applied to Korea as well:\n\n1. Rhee Syngman was an absolutely brutal dictator. He committed various [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodo_League_massacre) oftentimes killing [children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mungyeong_massacre) to achieve his political aims.

A more charitable framing of their grievances would have added much needed nuance to the season\u2019s conflict, especially if Korra actually took more of their complaints to heart.  It especially bothers me when the resolution to the conflict has non-benders acquiesce to the same status quo but under an elected leader. Representation matters, but the material circumstance of the majority seems unchanged.\n\nHowever, this critique assumes that the nonbenders\u2019 protests are actually legitimate. Perhaps, their oppression is minuscule and they simply harbor undue animosity toward benders. Though benders may have more physical power, we see this play out negatively on the lives of benders and nonbenders alike (lots of parents \u201ckilled\u201d by fire benders). While benders at the beginning hold overwhelming political representation, we also see members of both groups on either ends of the socio-economic ladder. This dynamic is ultimately left uncertain because the show spends more time exploring Korra\u2019s own anxiety over Amon (still interesting) and love triangles (a slow-motion trainwreck).\n\nThough I do love this show, part of my frustration with season 1 is the attempt to portray the anti-bending movement as an allegory for Communism. This parallel is obvious in both the equalists\u2019 rhetoric and iconography. However, I find the analogy between capital and bending inherently flawed because bending, though genetic, cannot be accumulated generationally nor redistributed. Additionally, the \u201chierarchy\u201d of bending is never demonstrated to show the same material reality as the discrepancy between the rich and poor or the worker and the factory-owner (hell, Hiroshi Sato is both a nonbender and an industrial capitalist).\n\nI also dislike the analogy of Communism and Fascism to Amon and Tarrlok: two ideological brothers using different means to achieve the same radical goal, both of which having been corrupted by an abusive upbringing and lust for power. I think this notion belies the many real problems that capitalism creates and that socialism seeks to address. The writers seem to dismiss this by portraying the non-bending protesters as unsympathetic, annoying, and illegitimate. Though this may just be due to improved writing in later seasons,  it\u2019s still unnerving how scary the show makes Amon out to be (they treat \u201cbring equalizied\u201d as if it\u2019s a character death scene) while finding every opportunity to make Kuvira seem sympathetic."}, {"id": "iblu9z", "n_comments": 65, "name": "CMV: Its perfectly okay to slut shame and not want to date sluts seriously.", "text": "Its perfectly ok to slut shame.

Following this thread, the things that causes men and women to be different is based partially in biology, but more importantly from that biology there is a set of social constructions that force women and men to act certain ways that mostly negatively affect women.\n\nSo for most of our human history there has been a relative harmony of men chasing deer with spears and fighting each other, while women would stay at the tribe doing everything else like making clothes, picking local agriculture, and giving attention to the young and old. This has carried over into civilized history as men's spears have turned into rifles and leaving the home for factory work. Yet, as technology has increased the athleticism of men is no longer required, cars move faster, guns kill better, and machines make better stronger tools. Likewise, rather than spending so many hours washing clothes and hand crafting them, a washing machine, dishwasher, and textile factories can outperform the tribal woman one hundred fold. Therefore, after the industrial revolution, there is no longer a strong argument that men and women should fill different roles in society since athleticism is no longer a dividing factor in work roles. Men and women's minds are equal, and the rest is irrelevant or can be disregarded.\n\nSo why do women believe they are men, and women believe they are men, if there in theory should be nothing separating the two sex's minds? The differences in gender performance are already a form of acting that is created by a historical past that we haven't been able to shake. To me, it seems that a MtF transgender is playing the role that he believes a woman to live, rather than the actual experience of a woman, and a FtM vice-versa. If we started where we are now and fast forward maybe another hundred years with even more technological progress, the need for a strong fit man to do a job will be a distant memory, why would men and women act different aside from childbirth?\n\nI just don't really understand, and I've always had this question and it's never really been answered, and I dare not ask it out loud as it will make it seem like I am trans-phobic. I believe they have the rights to do whatever they wish and get protection under the law, I just don't really understand what the, \"logic\" is.\n\n**TL;DR: There is no need for women and men to act different, it has been carried over from our past.

I agree with that argument, actually, but believe it would be a gross overreach of government authority to force people to donate blood or any other bodily fluid to another person, and therefore, would be an overreach to force people to carry the fetus to birth unwillingly.

There is also the idea that having to raise a child is proportionate consequence for intercourse, but consequences don't seem to fit the 'crime,' again see support for the death penalty (race plays a large part in this: [https://www.aclu.org/other/race-and-death-penalty](https://www.aclu.org/other/race-and-death-penalty), [https://capitalpunishmentincontext.org/issues/race](https://capitalpunishmentincontext.org/issues/race)). \n\nFinally, the watchwords of \"tough on crime.\" If conservatives were tough on crime, then conservatives would support abortion, as abortion is correlated with a reduction in crime.

Gets to reinvest its income taxes via a special account\n4. Pays well below market interest rates for treasury loans\n5.

Fedex and UPS have sued the USPS repeatedly for monopolistic business practices -- for example, undercutting market prices for packages (and then making up for it by raising the cost of stamps). \n\nTo be fair, the USPS is hamstrung by retirement fund laws put in place by legislators and unions, but so are other big companies.

I want to clarify that I\u2019m not saying that there is no natural inclination/explanation for homosexual behavior. However, that since homosexuality is a behavior and is embedded in an act, inherently is becomes a choice. That very fact makes sex and sexuality in general a choice, thus making heterosexuality a choice as well. \n\nA creature is not required to have sex in its lifetime, hence having sex, and the partner with whom one chooses to have it with is, and will always be, a choice... no matter how inclined one is to make it. \n\nI concede that there are choices which are harder to resist than others\u2014  for example, humans cannot choose whether to use the bathroom or not, your body makes that choice for you, however, they can choose to pee anywhere or in a bathroom, the latter being the one the human would be more INCLINED to do because of the social contract he\u2019s conditioned to follow. \n\nThere is nothing about sexuality which makes it a prerequisite for life, albeit necessary for continuation post life. But, legacy is also a choice. \n\nSo that\u2019s the crux of my argument... there are indeed factors which may incline a person towards homosexuality or otherwise, however, despite that, it is ones individual choice which categorizes him or her in their respective class of sexuality. \n\nI\u2019m very interested in being persuaded otherwise.\n\nEdit: I realize a lot of people saying that homosexuality is about ones attraction and not the act. And I want everyone to know, that I am not arguing that ones attraction to one sex or the other is a choice. My argument is that, ones attraction is not their sexuality. That sexuality is embedded in a measurable act, and that perhaps what everyone is describing deserves its own classification."}, {"id": "iab3ei", "n_comments": 319, "name": "CMV: Trump undercutting the USPS in right before an election with majority mail in ballots is election fraud.", "text": "Here is me reasoning as to why I hold this opinion:\n\n1) Trump has repeated several times that he is only underfunding and getting in the way of the USPS doing their job is because he wants better chances of winning, which he believes is only possible if he circumvents the USPS.\n\n2) Trump has never showed any interest before in cutting funds to the USPS, but as soon as we transitioned into using mail in ballots for this election, he suddenly threatened to cut funds.\n\n3) The man who Trump appointed as the Postmaster General of the United States, Louis DeJoy, is a mega donator to campaigns of politicians who are a member of the Republican Party, including Trump and several GOP Senators.

To be clear, I don't browse animemes and I've watched maybe 4 animes total in my life, this just sparked the contemplation of my current position where I don't care about slur words. I believe that what defines a word is how its used and additionally the context its used in. Putting aside the Skai Jackson debacle for a moment, there's a reason why \"Guacamole nigga penis\" has a very different cultural connotation than the n word itself with or without the hard r. Alt-right dogwhistles happen similarly where a word, phrase or symbol is repurposed through repeated context despite the the word/phrase/symbol itself being unassuming. The ok hand symbol is only means something because of how it's used and we can differentiate the ok hand symbol used for dogwhistles vs its more innocent usage. \n\nAs far as slurs go I don't think it's unreasonable to examine context rather than the word itself. For example, a trans women a trap is obviously incredibly transphobic because it's comparing someone who's male but dresses as a woman to a person who's womanhood is an important part of their identity, it's demeaning and unacceptable. But I don't think calling an anime dude who dresses or tries to look like a girl a trap is transphobic because that character isn't trans and no one is demeaning an identity by calling that character something they aren't unlike the earlier example.\n\nIn case anyone is wondering, I'm not trans. I'm a cis hetero dude so I will recognize there's an aspect of this I wouldn't be inherently a part of due to my identity. However, I am also a black person and I feel the exact same way about the n word. I don't care if someone uses the n word for a joke and I don't see why I should. Obviously context here matters but it matters in the same sense that insult humor does, you don't go up to someone you don't know that well and attempt insult humor for fairly obvious reasons.\n\nI can understand why you wouldn't want or enjoy that humor, just as some people don't like insult humor, humor is subjective.

It takes the failings of previous occupants of school desks and uses that to model the likely failings of this cohort.

I see this as a symptom of our two party system.\n___\n\nApplying concepts normally used in the economic realm to our current governmental system, we could compare the two political parties to big businesses:\n\nAs businesses are collectors of resources and distributors of services, I see political parties as collectors of ideas and distributors of solutions.\n\nJust as businesses work under the principles of supply of resources and demand for products, political parties work under the principle of supply of ideas and demand of solutions.\n\nAdditionally:\n\nThe Democratic party has a monopoly over the following:\n\n1. Most left wing social ideas\n1. Most left wing economic ideas\n1. Pro-Choice (a right wing libertarian idea)\n\nThe Republican party has a monopoly over the following:\n\n1. Most right wing social ideas\n1. Most right wing economic ideas\n1. Pro-Life (a left wing authoritarian idea)\n\nAn example of a \"political business\" trying to drive its way into the \"political market\", would be the Green Party trying to bring climate change to the forefront of discussion. However, the democratic party already has exponentially more \"idea capital\" so that the ideas of the Green Party, though maybe better, are overwhelmed by the widespread demand for solutions to other things.\n\nSupporting research for my theory: \n\n(1) https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2321023016634928?journalCode=inpa\n\n(2) https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199214273.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199214273-e-9\n\n___\nWhat's the biggest issue we face today? I personally think it's climate change. My #1 choice in any election ***should be*** the person running on what I believe to be the best idea in regards to stopping climate change. Will I vote for the Green Party candidate this November? No, because that is a wasted vote because of the political power and capital of the Democratic party.\n\nIf I and all others who saw climate change as the biggest issue facing our country were able to put the Green Party Candidate as our #1 and the Democratic candidate as #2, we would actually see how many people really want to stop climate change. If the ideas of the Green Party were superior enough, then it would get the most votes and we would elect someone that would enact policy in attempts to curb climate change *in the way by which the majority of people want*. If not, those votes would go to the person that represented those voters the second best, and so on.\n\nIf someone were to, say, prioritize their pro-life stance as #1 and their belief in a strong social safety net as #2, for whom would they vote in our current political climate? They would vote for the Republican candidate because banning abortion is not only the most important outcome to them, but it is also a much more concise idea. Thus, they may not go out of their way to learn that a good social safety net may bring about improvements in upward mobility, decreases in poverty, and ultimately decreases in the need for abortion ***and the social safety net itself***, but that is a far more difficult idea to convey than the idea of \"Pro-Life\".\n\nWith a multi-party system, the choices in all elections would be much more clear. If you're the person from above, you would rank the anti-abortion candidate as your #1. Then, you would rank the candidate that is advocating for social safety nets as your #2. If the Anti-Abortion candidate loses, then your vote still goes to the person that wants to improve the social safety net. If they lose, then you get your third choice and so on.\n\nIn the long run, this leads to decentralization of power and encourages people to vote because they don't have to worry as much about their vote going to someone that contradicts their other political positions. It is a balance between a purely direct democracy and a purely representative democracy. It is also a way to make sure the government aligns with the collective conscience of the society it is representing. Ultimately, it strengthens our representative democracy.\n___\n**TL;DR: Ranked choice voting is a purely moderate libertarian idea that leads to decentralization of power and gives more value to each individual ballot. As it is now, a vote for a third party advocating for legislation to curb climate change is a vote against your own interests as the Democratic party already \"owns\" that idea along with all of its other political platforms for which it receives votes.**\n___\nEDIT: Looking at [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._States_by_Vote_Distribution,_2016_\\(Republican_Party\\).svg), we can see that the majority of people within many states that Donald Trump won in the Republican primary in 2016 did NOT vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primaries.

You lose precious time if you actually must engage the front brake to avoid a collision.  In addition, any energy wich is not covered into heat by the break disc might be converted into breaking bones upon impact. \n* Second, you can no longer do engine breaking and in the worst if you slip of the clutch, because you are hit by the cager on the left sied, your bike will make a big jump. Furthermore, the only breaking option you are left with is the rear break activate by your right foot. \n* Third, if the cager's mistake was because they did not see you and you start to rev bomb it is like  you appeared out of nowhere with a howling engine. Just like some mad maverick speeding along with 210 mph. No wonder, thinks the cager, did they not see you if you ride like a suicidal lunatic. They will have no  sense of wrongdoing.\n* Fourth, it is not an universally recognized hazard signal. You know what is? The horn, which conveniently is at the other side of throttle and brake lever. It might not be always heard by the cager, just like rev bombing might be ignored. But if it is heard by the other driver hears the horn it is clear that something is wrong with situation and act accordingly. Whereas, if they hear the rev bomb they think something is mentally wrong with you and act accordingly.  By the way, if you think your stock horn is not loud enough: Get a new better horn. \n* Fifth, it is not nice for the engine of your bike. The red line is the absolut operational limit of the engine and should be avoid. Lubrication film might be insufficient or even break down. Increased wear and tear will occur. Not mentioning the ever so slightly chance that the piston will kiss your valves as they might not close fast enough. If you love your bike you should treat in a manner that it will give only joy in all the many miles you will ride it.\n* Finally, it is simply an aggressive move. Aggression and anger have absolutely no business on the road. It narrows your perception as you are still focused on passed events. Keep calm, friendly and ride with a smile and open eyes. Adapt before you have to react.

Back in the 70s, we changed the voting age from 21 to 18 to reflect the age citizens get drafted. Why should they die in a war they didn't vote for? A similar situation is happening in our current time. Issues like education directly affect children while climate change and pollution will affect them in the future. Shouldn't they have a say in these matters that directly pertain to them and their future?\n\nThe second reason I believe this is due to our low voter turnout. Its clear that older Americans are voting more than younger Americans. Why is this the case? Most experts believe its due to [apathy among younger Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections#Age). The reason for this, I believe, is due to an increase in responsibility. 18 is the age you legally become an adult, where you must get a job or go to college. You usually also move out of the house. Now we are also expecting them to start to research about politics? Obviously they are going to be apathetic. The key problem here though is this is the age they are supposed to *start* to research about politics. If we got kids interested in politics at a younger age, I believe they would maintain that interest as adults. Education is certainly something that can be improved to solve this issue, but why should children care about politics if they have no vote? It is not like they can use that knowledge for anything. If we gave children suffrage they would have legitimate motivation to research politics, thus decreasing voter apathy.\n\nTo address some common counterarguments, first we have the case that children are incapable of voting due to their brain not being fully developed. The main problem with this reasoning is that [your brain is only fully developed at 25](https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=understanding-the-teen-brain-1-3051), yet we have people under 25 already voting. Not to mention that adults don't have to prove any level of reasoning to vote (nor should they.) As for mentally disabled people, most states will [remove their right to vote if they are under conservatorship](http://www.bazelon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2016_State-Laws-Affecting-Voting-Rights-of-PWD.pdf). However, most children are under guardianship which does not disenfranchise you. If mental acuity really was a concern, we'd either push back the voting age to 25 or support some kind of literacy test (which have historically been used to disenfranchise minorities.)\n\nThe second counterargument has to do with double voting. Specifically, giving children suffrage will result in them voting as their parents through their influence. I concede that this will still be an issue. However, it could be solved with an education system with more diverse beliefs or just diversity in general as studies have shown that [exposure to different ideas and beliefs does cause children to abandon their parents' beliefs](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/why-does-the-apple-fall-far-from-the-tree-how-early-political-socialization-prompts-parentchild-dissimilarity/AB191D8C85DD9C046032DA9A4098EE0D).

And given that we would be at the forefront of creating these AI robots, they might share similar characteristics as us (we would program that in).\n\nD) It is not exactly clear to me on what would qualify as being pro-AI.  But I suspect that any move that we have made to promote or to expedite artificial general intelligence would be considered pro-AI.  Even for non-experts, it could be as simple as making regular donations to AGI research.\n\nE) It is conceivable that the AI overlords would have a gigantic big database of all of our actions/moves in the future and as such, good deeds from us will not go unnoticed.\n\nF) Compared to the potential upside, I don't see that much downside to this.\n\nSome final thoughts.\n\n\\- I will NOT be convinced by an argument trying to dissuade AGI.  There is enough probability that this will occur here such that this just seems uninteresting for me given that I am not making the strong claim that it is certain that AGI would materialize.\n\n\\- I can be convinced that this would be a waste of money, but this can also be negotiated by the amount of donation or effort.\n\n\\- There is an argument to be made that even if this scenario does not materialize during our lifetime, it might eventually happen some time in the future, and there might be some resurrection type of a technology that can benefit the dead pro-AI people.\n\n\\- I guess I should reveal that I am an atheist and I am operating from that religious framework, so any religious argument will not convince me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  the faction argument was quite convincing as there is a risk when it comes to supporting the loser and being punished for the support (as opposed to not doing anything).

However, I recently had a collision with a friend who is adamantly skeptical of the benefits of changing the law. (This is in the context of the upcoming national [referendum](https://www.referendums.govt.nz/cannabis/index.html) in New Zealand).\n\nMy reasons for holding this view are:\n\n1. Marijuana is just as safe, if not safer than other controlled substances like alcohol and tobacco which remain legal. It is also significantly less addictive and has less long-term health consequences on the body (especially when vaporized or eaten, as opposed to smoked).\n2. When used irresponsibly (in isolation to other drugs), Marijuana does not cause violence and does not reduce inhibitions, like alcohol commonly does. It is also incredibly difficult to overdose on marijuana, compared to alcohol.\n3. When used responsibly, marijuana's harms are only a significant problem for brain development in young people, or people prone to psychosis or schizophrenia. Again, similar if not worse harms can result from \"responsible\" alcohol and tobacco use as well, not to mention other medicines and non-medicines ranging from over-the-counter painkillers to refined sugar.\n4. Making marijuana (and other recreational drugs) decriminalized takes the focus away from punishing responsible users, and reduces wasted law enforcement resources. It enables better, more cost-effective treatment options to be available for those struggling with substance abuse. It also enables research to occur with less bureaucratic limitations.\n5. Making marijuana specifically available for legal recreational use and allowing small home-growing and trading operations would basically eliminate organized crime interest, improving public safety through easier access.\n6. Making marijuana available for retail sales with proper age restrictions and educational resources will generate jobs for those who wish to grow it, and additional tax revenues to support addicts and fund other important government health programs. It will also remove limitations upon the hemp and medical marijuana industries, reducing overheads and increasing profitability for these goods.\n7. Recreational Marijuana, when used responsibly, is a fun substance. It can relieve stress, improve mood, boost creativity, and its psychoactive effects heighten our senses and the depth with which we can experience certain activities.\n8. Given the above, we cannot ever realistically hope to eliminate demand for marijuana, and as far as I know, not a single country on earth has succeeded in doing this. If we do not change our laws to at least decriminalize, we will continue to make criminals out of innocent people. Prohibition failed with alcohol in the US, and the majority of harms from controlled substances come from those that are legal (such as opiod painkillers).\n\nI would also just like to add that most of the research and well-reasoned opposition I have read really fails to address which is to me the most straight-forward and important reason to support legalization: **reasonably differentiating marijuana from alcohol**. You need to justify one being legal while the other remains illegal. I believe that all of the harm/benefit analyses that apply to alcohol, also apply to marijuana, and that if one thinks one should be illegal, then you should want the other to be illegal as well. If you want this, I think you should then have to demonstrate that both being legal will result in more overall harm, than just alcohol being legal on its own already does.\n\nI think that just about does it.

In 2013, the average American adult had a smartphone, which turned the internet into a universal experience.

In 2012, TV was considered unstoppable.

The accessibility of the internet also allows the creation of new trends and memes, as user generated content can be made much quicker than traditional media.

Specifically, he rejected the principle of secession that underlay America's own declaration of independence and was a white supremacist (until very late) who did not believe freed slaves could be equal citizens but should instead be repatriated to Africa. *Note: I am not saying that Lincoln was a terrible president, since the circumstances he faced were complicated (and American standards for presidents are low in any case). I am only saying that he does not deserve to come first or at least top 3 of nearly every survey.*\n\nFurther justifications\n\n Lincoln arguably caused the civil war by failures of statesmanship.\n\n1. The Southern states launched their secession upon news that Lincoln had been elected because they believed he planned to abolish slavery nationally. Lincoln was an extraordinarily divisive presidential candidate (and if he din't know it, that too was a failure of statesmanship)\n2. Once the Southern states had declared independence, it was Lincoln's **choice** to fight a war to stop them. He could have let them secede peacefully as was their declared intent. (This would not only have avoided the worst war in American history, but would also have been more consistent with the moral principles of states rights and secession of America's founding.  \n3. It is commonly argued that the civil war was about ending slavery, but this is only partly true. It is true that the Southern states seceded because they wanted to preserve slavery. However, Lincoln's justification for going to war was to preserve the Union, not to end slavery. (ex. There were slave states on the Union side, and they were also excluded from the Emancipation Proclamation when it came a year and a half into the war.)\n\nCounterfactual: Could things have turned out better without a President Lincoln? It is all too plausible to answer yes\n\n1. If a different candidate had won the 1860 election, secession might not have happened then (or at all), or it might have been managed very differently because that president would have had the trust and legitimacy in the South that Lincoln's Republican party lacked.\n2. Slavery was an appalling evil, but the civil war (Lincoln's special contribution) was not necessary to end it. Regardless of whether the South had seceded, slavery would probably have ended anyway, as it did in every other Western country - with Brazil the last to do so, a mere 13 years after the US civil war. (This is mainly because slavery's increasingly obvious disadvantages in a modern capitalist economy reduced political opposition to morally based abolitionist movements.)\n3. Over the long run, African Americans did not especially benefit from Lincoln's choices. Keeping the South in the Union had the result of giving white supremacy a political veto over national policy for another hundred years (actually putting America behind other former slave economies like Brazil). For example, the political block of former Confederate states was powerful enough to prevent the federal government enforcing the Reconstruction Amendments that were supposed to recognise African Americans' political and civil rights until the 1950s. *(I accept this argument is more tendentious since it presumes that the suffering of African Americans in an independent Confederacy would not have been significantly worse than under Jim Crow)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal note. I do have an speculative explanation for Lincoln's undeservedly high standing which may relate to the fact that I am not an American. When something extraordinarily terrible happens - like a civil war- we search for a narrative that will make sense of the events and comfort us, e.g. by framing the huge costs as a sacrifice for a proportionately worthy goal. Therefore the very fact that the war was so awful makes it necessary to inflate Lincoln's greatness and goodness to compensate.  (Even losers in a war can be comforted by the idea that they were beaten by the best.)

In some African cultures, it was a sign of your prowess as a warrior. Some other cultures viewed it as a symbol of class structure\n\nOf course, with colonialism comes the attempt of (and often success) erasure of one's cultural practices and forcing people into some form of Christianity. This combined with the fact that the resurgence of tattoos was a 'lower-class' practice makes it so that nowadays even though most laypeople don't care if you have a tattoo it is still considered 'unprofessional'. Which within a capitalist society is practically a death sentence. For example, sailors and others considered the lower class got tattoos to signify their voyages. In Japan, I believe, it was tattooed on prisoners.\n\nThe history is varied but still culminates in the reality that in the U.S. today many professions frown upon tattoos and ask that you cover up tattoos.

In the end, they'll get better, get more wins, maybe a new kill record, and accomplish nothing useful. People who have spent hundreds of hours in video games have wasted hundreds of hours they could have used to do something useful. People who spent excessive time on video games could have used that time to be good at anything, but yet they chose to use their time to get good at something that won't help them with anything (unless they get paid playing video games, which most people don't) and is nothing more than a waste of time. I myself used to be an avid gamer; however, I started using my time more productively and got into working out and started spending more time with my friends. If I spent the time I spent playing video games working out or something useful, I would have actually been good at something back when I spent my free time unproductively playing video games video games. In the hours of time playing video games, I've made no money, developed no useful skills in life, and achieved a lot of in-game achievements that did nothing but make me wish I achieved something actually useful that would help me in life. The only half-way productive time I spent on video games was the time I was in the voice chat with my friends getting to know them better; however, I would have accomplished a lot more socially if I just socialized with them in-person or in a video call. In my view, I simply can't see video games as a useful way to use time and feel there are so many better ways to use time; however, my view is subject to change and I'm open minded."}, {"id": "iasv1r", "n_comments": 38, "name": "CMV: You have a choice - You can be a good person, or you can be a successful person.

Moral integrity above all else.\n\nSo on the path to success, when it comes down to \"it's us or them\" and in order for victory to be on your side you may have to take an unsavory approach...

Otherwise, you just end up in a big echo chamber that confirms what your world view looks like.

We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:\n\n 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.\n* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. \n* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.\n* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._\n\n 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.\n* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. \n* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.\n* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (\"Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?\") are totally fine.\n* But back to back updates (\"Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!\" day 2: \"Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!\" day 3: \"Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!\") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.\n* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.\n\nWe'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.\n\n---\n\nThanks to [Ebbie45](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d1w1cx/meta_cool_were_at_2mil_now_what_you_must_read_this/ezql6gf/), [UnfairAdvantage](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d1w1cx/meta_cool_were_at_2mil_now_what_you_must_read_this/ezvbum9/), and [maddiecat5](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d1w1cx/meta_cool_were_at_2mil_now_what_you_must_read_this/ezrl0bp/) among others for the ideas they put forward during the open comment period."}, {"id": "g7ukh7", "n_comments": 0, "name": "[meta] One (1) day bans for moral judgment posts e.g. Am I the asshole?

I don't know what to do.", "text": "&#x200B;\n\nHello, I guess in some way I wanted to give you people an update on what has been going on with me. When I posted my first post, I was slightly drunk, it was the night the police showed up at my house and rang the doorbell and I was confused. All of your messages, messages from random strangers, helped me in some way. I\u2019d like to thank whoever sent me that poem by Mary Elizabeth Frye - Do not stand at my grave and weep, we used that for the invitation to her party. And also Bianca who painted that beautiful painting of her which she sent me by email. Thank you. \n\nAlso, fair warning, this might be quite a long post, this might trigger someone and I\u2019ve been writing this post over several days as more information keeps trickling in and the picture of that night is becoming clearer and clearer. I think I'm also mainly writing this for myself.\n\nWhat happened that night (the 22nd of July) is just still so surreal.\n\nI'm sitting at my mothers desk right now, in her little office in our apartment that I grew up in, in Berlin. Her presence in some way is all around me. It has been 23 days since the police showed up in front of my door at 3 in the morning and asked if they could come in. Since my stepfather hanged himself. Everything has been so confusing\n\nIt's all sort of a mixture between crying, screaming, yelling, throwing things, and just emptiness. I go through phases (someone linked that famous post about grief and god it's so accurate) and it's really hard to cope. Since that night I haven't ever actually been alone. This is somewhat exhausting to me in some ways but probably also very important. \n\nI\u2019m going to go through the series of events and facts because I also want to set it right, since in the media (since some of you found the articles online and connected the dots) there is so much false information, it\u2019s hard to believe. \n\nMy Mother and my stepfather were together for 8 years and he has only been living in Berlin since then. He has children from his previous marriage, that is all I will say. I am my mothers only daughter. \n\nHe did not call me and confess to what he did (as many report) but he called some vaguely mutual friend who he walks his dog with sometimes. This was some time after 11 PM. At this point he was already up at the summer house. It takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get up there. This means my mother had been dead for about 2 hours (it says so in the police report as well). \n\nThe summer house did not belong to my stepdad, but to my mom. She poured all of the little money she had and renovated it by hand. It does not in any way belong to him. \n\nThe police showed up at my moms and my apartment late at night, they didn\u2019t know the address of where he might have gone and were also worried he might come and harm me since he had the keys to our apartment as well. I was watching a movie with a friend of mine. \n\nI posted on reddit a few hours later, the news articles started coming out the next day, connecting my stepfather to a celebrity. I posted because I needed help. \n\nThis celebrity and my stepfather are by no means \u201efriends\u201c they are acquaintances and there is no reason for him to be brought into any of this.\n\nThat was wednesday night/thursday morning. On friday I was at the LKA (criminal police) and gave a 3 hour statement about them and their relationship.\n\n***(This next part is about my feelings and mainly about my mom, feel free to skip it)***\n\nSince then my whole world has been turned upside down. My mother, the person I honestly loved most in the whole world was just torn from me. It feels like I have this big bleeding hole inside of me. I\u2019m not crying all the time, sometimes I feel ok, but more like empty. \n\nMy mother has been with me my whole life, the whole 21 years and I\u2019m not just saying this because she is dead, she is honestly the best mother you could wish for. She is goofy and caring, her laugh is infectious, she has such integrity. She is the most animated person, when she tells a story she will get up from the table and gesture all around. Her eyes are so shining. I think I might show some pictures of her, because I want people to recognise her beauty. I want the whole world to know she is gone. Because this is an honest and devastating loss to the world, believe me. \n\nShe is so talented. She got her bachelor in Art History in America, she has worked odd jobs all her life. She\u2019s always been a hippy. When I was little she started working at this English-language summer camp in Th\u00fcringen in Germany and she used to take me there for many weeks with her, on a hill, on a farm in the middle of a giant forest. \n\nShe\u2019s a magician in the kitchen, she can open the fridge door and magically make something out of leftover ingredients that nobody would ever think tastes good (noodles and carrots anyone?). \n\nShe likes to make everything herself. She would let milk go bad and make her own ricotta, I have a thousand jars of her homemade chutneys and jams. She baked her own bread years before the pandemic. She made her own vinegar, her own syrups and alcohol and her hot sauces are legendary. I used to come home and open the fridge door and I\u2019d ask her which of the many bowls she had covered with little plates were edible, and which weren\u2019t ready yet. \n\nSince she\u2019s dead I have found so many started experiments of things I don\u2019t even know of what they are. I wish I could ask her. There are so many things I wished I had the time to ask her. Writing this is making me cry again. \n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, March I believe, I moved back in with her and she ordered 14 different bottles of white wine on Lidl and every night we\u2019d drink one together while we cooked and I\u2019d write notes on the color and the taste and we\u2019d give it a 1-10 on the Lidl scale.\n\nShe\u2019s one of the funniest people I know. And she is so forgiving. Even when I was younger we would get into huge blow up fights sometimes and we\u2019d scream. But five minutes afterwards she\u2019d come into my room and she\u2019d apologise and tell me she loved me more than anything in the world. \n\nWe told each other we loved one another all the time, sometimes just randomly and hug each other. I\u2019m so so grateful for this.\n\nI would say we had a rare mother-daughter bond. I love her with all my heart, she has always been my idol, my role-model. If I\u2019m even half the person she is, as generous, hilarious, creative, emotional, forgiving and understanding, I will be lucky. I see her face in front of me all the time. I can hear her laugh. \n\nFuck, I\u2019d really give anything for her to be with me right now. Anything. It really tears me apart. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for her, I would have probably been dead 1 1/2 years ago. She pulled me out of my dark holes, she loved me unconditionally. She isn\u2019t just my mother, she is my best friend. And I will never ever forgive him for taking him from me. Especially since more and more facts are coming out. \n\n***(End of emotional bit)*** \n\nIt\u2019s important to preface that I knew their relationship, or to be more exact, I was the closest to both of them together. And it\u2019s important to understand that he wasn\u2019t some creepy, abusive, scary bad guy. \n\nI loved him. He was like a best friend to me. When he came into my mothers and my life, I took him in with open arms. I\u2019ve confided in him, I\u2019ve told him secrets, we\u2019ve had running jokes. We made bets with each other that I usually won and he had to pay up. He was my family. \n\nThis makes me feel just as conned. I feel cheated. I feel like I\u2019ve been blind. I\u2019ve had bad fights with him as well and I knew about their fights but I didn\u2019t see this coming, not even a little bit. \n\nI would never put my mother in harms way. I guess this is why she must have kept things hidden from me. \n\nThe murder happened in his apartment (they had separate apartments) and afterwards he drove his car up to my mothers country house that they both spent every weekend at. Hunting mushrooms, planting and building things, going swimming in the lake thats right in front of the door. This was their refuge and I\u2019m assuming this is the reason he went there. \n\nSince the day this has happened I\u2019ve always assumed he blew up about something, lost control and he killed my mother while he wasn\u2019t clear headed. This is what made sense to me. That he killed himself because he killed my mother. Because he didn\u2019t know how to continue. \n\nBut the more time goes by and the more facts we uncover (we being my mothers friends and I, not the police), the more it seems it was the opposite. \n\nThat he killed my mother because he wanted to kill himself. And that he was covering something up. \n\nSince the night the police showed up, they\u2019ve been asking me if I could know where their laptops are, they both had a laptop. And both are missing. They found the empty cases, but they\u2019re gone. \n\nThis sparked suspicion in us. His phone is gone as well, my mothers is not, the police gave it to me. Then there are the other facts. (TRIGGER WARNING) Despite what it said in the media, she didn\u2019t have multiple stab wounds in her chest. There was only one very precise and very small wound that caused her death. He only let someone know what he did after he was up at the house. When he arrived at the cabin, he apparently parked normally, even greeted one of the neighbours. He called the friend and threw his phone into the lake, destroyed the laptops and threw them in the lake as well. \n\nAt least this is what we suspected. Until this weekend. All of my moms close friend drove up to the cabin with us, brought diving goggles, snorkels and everything. We spent hours poking around that lake with sticks and diving and guess what. We found something. We couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nI won\u2019t specify what, but we were successful and the pieces are falling into place. That this was cold blooded.\n\nI don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m writing all this down in a word document and why I\u2019m going to post it on reddit, but I need to share. \n\nI feel so much hatred and so much anger. I feel it boiling underneath my skin and it keeps threading to come out. I\u2019ve smashed so much stuff, I\u2019ve gotten so angry. Sometimes I snap and I scream at people and other times I just cry and beat my pillows. And sometimes I\u2019m very calm. I can still feel joy. And my mother has this amazing circle of friends that I\u2019ve known my whole life and who are supporting me. I saw her body in the coffin and I will never be able to get that image out of my head. She was so tiny, it breaks my heart. \n\nI\u2019ve also slept two nights at the cabin and in the dark every shadow looked like my stepfather. I\u2019ve become scared of locking my doors at night. Murder used to seem something so far off, something that happened to other people, in a different world, separate from mine. But now it\u2019s not. And I won\u2019t let him spoil her place. I won\u2019t let him take that away from her and from me. I refuse. \n\nI just miss her. I miss everything about her. It hasn\u2019t been that long yet and all I want is for her to hug me and say my name and say she loves me and that she thinks I\u2019m an amazing young woman. I want her to cuddle with me in bed which she did for so many years until I felt myself too old. \n\nI want to sit at the kitchen table in the morning with her and have her ask me about what I dreamt about last night and both of us talk about our dreams. For her to talk with me about my story ideas and my poetry and to talk with her about the book that she was writing and will never finish. \n\nIt just hurts so much, I don\u2019t know how to ever get past this. She has always been the most amazing person I know and I can\u2019t get over this. I don\u2019t know how to get over this. I feel lost. I feel like I have to grow up very fast now and carry her with me. \n\nTheres so much more to tell. So much. But I should probably stop somewhere. I would appreciate all advice. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n\nEdit: don't know if I did this right, I don't usually use imgur https://imgur.com/gallery/lkjz7Wd"}, {"id": "ibhf1h", "n_comments": 482, "name": "My wife of 15 years came out as gay, and I've been a wreck.", "text": "My wife recently came out to me that she was gay.

I was honest and said yeah. She asked how often. I said often. She went ballistic. Asking why I was still talking to someone who offered me to sleep in their bed and have sex with me?

Mark has never dated since, even though in all my experience he is an extremely kind, generous, and handsome man; he\u2019s simply been uninterested in romance. Ben is an absolute sweetheart and as you can imagine, we\u2019re very close.\n\nEarly this year, my living situation broke down (slumlord, roommate\u2019s abusive boyfriend was starting to abuse me) and Mark helped me break my lease and I moved into his guest room until I could find my own place again. Then COVID hit, and we\u2019ve been isolating together ever since. Since Mark is extremely busy during the day, I\u2019ve found myself cooking all our meals, cleaning the apartment, and entertaining Ben.\n\nToday, Mark and I had a serious debate over Ben\u2019s kindergarten and what elementary school he should go to, and I realized we\u2019ve crossed the parent-nanny line a long time ago. All my other nanny friends, even the ones to single parents, basically get told what to do by their employers. I\u2019ve been an active participant in things like finding a pediatrician, diet, and education. Mark and I routinely have long late night discussions about household finances, to do lists, groceries, and personal issues and thoughts. I\u2019ve held him while he cried, for God\u2019s sake.\n\nRealizing that I\u2019ve become a househusband also made me realize there is absolutely no boundaries between me and Mark. I have a shitty relationship with my own family, and I\u2019ve found myself enfolded into his. I don\u2019t even know how to begin establishing a boundary between us of employer-employee, our lives are so intertwined. How can I even begin to emotionally prepare myself if this relationship ever blows up in my face? Ben\u2019s going to end up the most hurt.\n\nEDIT: thank you everyone for your comments. Sorry if I don't answer all of them, I'm feeling very overwhelmed and emotional on top of everything else. I'll try to clear some things up:\n\n1. I've been babysitting since I was 13, but I became a professional when I was in college. Ben, however, was the first kid I've cared for full-time rather than just between school getting out and parents coming home or during date nights. Mark, however, usually gets Ben ready in the mornings and takes over after he's done with work at around 6:30 pm. He's a very involved father, but being a single parent with a highly demanding job is hard.\n\n2. I get paid full time live-in rates for my area (high cost of living city) plus room and board. I'm comped generously. I had originally wanted to save up to get my master's in education but now I'm very glad I decided not to.\n\n3. My city is already near-impossible to live in without roommates unless you want to pay out the nose for a mold-infested basement closet. Lining up roommates and getting an apartment is hard enough without a worldwide plague going on, so just \"moving out\" isn't really an option for the time being.\n\nTL;DR: realized me and my employer have next to no professional boundaries between our lives, and I don\u2019t know if I can start establishing them now."}, {"id": "ibphcl", "n_comments": 36, "name": "Found out I was a mistress -update", "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hz2ujd/found_out_i_was_a_mistresswhat_do_i_do/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nSo I told the wife.

I guess one of her parents is essentially a hoarder. Anyway, my girlfriend seems basically incapable of even *seeing* messes. (It also feels like she\u2019s incapable of seeing cleanliness. Like, it\u2019s as if she can\u2019t see a difference between a clean space and a messy one.)\n\nWe\u2019ve been living together for the last two months during Covid. We usually live in different nearby cities and see each other every weekend, but this is the first time we\u2019ve spent more than a week or two together. At first, I was like, \u201cI can teach her the skills to clean up after herself!\u201d But while some of the systems I\u2019ve tried to create are helping, it feels like she still hasn\u2019t caught on the principles of just cleaning up after yourself.\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s being purposefully disrespectful. We\u2019ve had some major blowouts over this, and she\u2019ll cry and say she\u2019s ashamed of this part of herself and feels like there\u2019s something wrong with her brain. She also has hypothyroidism (she\u2019s medicated) and says she had years when she hardly had any energy, and she didn\u2019t clean at all, and she feels like it altered her.\n\nI know our arguments are miserable for her, and yet she\u2019ll still create a mess like the very next morning. Or she\u2019ll, like, do dishes and give me a look like she\u2019s trying to please me (which makes me feel terrible), and ironically the dishes hardly need doing and there\u2019s a huge mess somewhere else! Like, she wants to help, but she can\u2019t tell what to do. It\u2019s making my head explode.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ve been cleaning up after her so that our surroundings don\u2019t drive me crazy, and it feels like every time I sort something out, she just undoes it. I want to be patient, but I'm learning I'm not very good at that. So now I\u2019m even more hyper-focused on messes \u2014 I\u2019ll see some stuff left out that wouldn\u2019t have bothered me before, and it kind of festers in my mind. I\u2019m becoming more and more critical, and I'll get grumpy and resentful, and it\u2019s bleeding into other parts of the relationship.\n\nShe just wants me to tell her what to do, but I feel like pointing out every little thing she needs to pick up or clean is almost as much work as cleaning myself \u2014 plus, I\u2019d probably be telling her to pick up/throw out/put away things many many times a day, which would make me feel kind of shitty. And sometimes it feels like she just doesn't want to do the work (but I don't know if that's true or not).\n\nI guess my question is\u2026 is there some kind of help for people who are pathologically messy? Like, are there professionals who don\u2019t just clean for you/organize your space, but can teach people how to be cleaner? Is there a way I can detach and stop feeling so hyper-focused on the mess? How do I stop this from ruining our relationship?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My gf can\u2019t seem to tell the difference between clean and messy. I clean up after her because I\u2019m the only person who will be bothered if it\u2019s messy, but it feels like a Sisyphean task and is making me feel more and more critical of her and damaging our relationship.  \n\n\nETA: Thank you for all the advice, it's really helpful to hear about other people with similar situations and what they've done. My girlfriend also said I should have included information about how I've kind of branched out to become more critical of other things about her too, which is true. From my perspective, I feel like the cleaning issue has put me in a grumpy and critical mindset, and now I know I'm being a jerk and overwhelming her with criticisms, and it makes her feel like I don't like her. I want to stop this, so advice on that is also welcome.

My wife and our son (3) went to visit family for 2 weeks in a neighboring state since they have had no cases in their area and things are more or less \"normal,\" this would also give my wife a much needed break as the grandparents could watch the kiddo.\n\nWhile there, wife was hanging out with an old family friend (M50), who told my wife he wanted her to enjoy her little vacation and free time and had a lot of activities planned for them. He would take her shopping, to the lake, out for dinner, pretty much all the stuff she loved doing but couldn't due to lockdown/no babysitter. I was aware they were doing this but wasn't concerned due to the long friendship and trust of the friend, as well as with my wife. Honestly, she needed a break, and this seemed like it would help her a lot. \n\nOne night after drinking at his house they ended up naked and having sex. My wife told me that while there was PIV, after only a little bit she realized that what she was doing was wrong and stopped it. No one finished. However, there was an earlier incident where he ended up giving her oral sex to completion. \n\nMy wife just came home today and once kiddo was asleep she confessed all of the above to me. I'm shocked, betrayed, all the feelings that a cheated on person can feel. I'm angry at my wife, angry at my friend, despaired because now I don't know what's going to happen with my family. One second I want to get a divorce because I feel betrayed, the next I want to fix things and save my family. To compound my feelings, my wife is partially blaming me for what happened. Saying that if I treated her better and showered her with attention like our (ex)friend then she would never have been attracted to him. I'll admit that our marriage has been rocky for a while and that she is right that I haven't been very affectionate with her as I should, but her actions just take it to a whole different level and really can't be compared. \n\nWhat do I do? Where do I go from here? My first suggestion I said to my wife is that we should get marriage counseling but she said she didn't need it. She's fully aware of what she did and doesn't need someone to explain to her why she did what she did. She did say that she wants to fix our marriage, and I do think she feel bad for what she did, but at the same time it seems that she thinks her confession was the only step to reconciliation that she needed to make. I want things to work, at the very least for our son, but everything is so raw and fresh I don't know what to do. \n\nTomorrow I'll look into counseling for myself to help work through my feelings, but I figure why not ask a bunch of internet strangers for advice.

I told her about how her family actually hurt my feelings and that I wouldn't mind stepping down or even not attending if she wanted me too. \n\nAnd she yelled at me for even asking and told me that she'd already sent the new invites to some of our other friends and replaced her bridesmaids as they were all her cousins and her fiance's sisters. She told me that she was upset, not at me at her family, for being really shitty  but that was it and then told me that she wouldn't invite them, even if I wasn't attending. \n\n She then told me that if I truly did feel uncomfortable or worried for my safety I can skip it and she wouldn't mind.\n\nWe're going to pick out our dresses for the wedding tomorrow and I am the maid of honor.

We've both been suffering from depression and other mental illnesses that have been exacerbated by covid-19, with the stresses of our daughter being trapped at home not being able to go out anywhere we've been going pretty crazy. \n\nI've been working from home, while my wife is a stay at home mother, we haven't had any romance in our relationship for a long time but I thought we were happy to just keep on keeping on until we waited out the coronavirus and life returned to a little more normal. We have wanted to work on our relationship but neither of us really put in the work.\n\nAnyhow, on to the reason I made this post, I noticed my wife had been extra protective of her phone, I saw a text on there from a person I didn't recognize but since my eyesight isn't the best all I saw was the name of a person, it was a fairly gender neutral name but combined with the being protective of her phone I became a little suspicious. I wanted to check and see if there was anything going on because I didn't feel comfortable confronting her about it, I spent 3 days waiting for an opportunity to look at her phone because of how well she guarded it, but I finally managed to look at 6am one morning while she was taking our daughter to the bathroom after getting up and I pulled up the messages app in iphone and the most recent message was from the same name I had seen earlier and it was a message that could not be taken as any context but sexual.\n\nSince my wife had to take our daughter to an appointment I didn't want to upset her before that, So our daughter could retain normalcy for the while. While I was waiting I checked our mobile provider account page and it showed that there had been hundreds of messages sent between my wife and this guy over the past couple weeks. After they got back I confronted my wife about it. She said that yes she had been flirting with this person that she met randomly in a video game. She said that she had been wanting to talk to me about it and that she wants the opportunity to explore this because it is the first thing that has made her happy in a long time. \n\nShe said that her ideal is that we both explore relationships with other people and then choose each other again. I'm totally against the idea of open relationships, especially in the case of my wife who had a history of cheating with previous partners. \n\nI thought since we'd been able to hold this together for 8 years we'd be able to make it through without any cheating but I guess I was wrong.\n\nI don't make enough money to support myself, pay childcare and support my daughter and my wife doesn't make any money at all so I'm at a loss for what to do.

Sorry! \n\nSo, I often say my life story is somewhat soap opera like because it\u2019s maybe a little crazy.\n\nI was the product of an affair between my single mom and married Dad. They met when they worked together. I was born about a year or two after he had a daughter with his wife.\nHe told his mom (my paternal grandmother) about me and and she came to see me when I was born. Other than that NO ONE knew the secret.\n\nI grew up living with my mom, with my Dad visiting often. I never really thought anything of it. He was often there for big events (ie. my birthday or going somewhere special in the summer). That was our norm. As I got older I asked more questions but carefully because it was just one of those things we didn\u2019t discuss. And as I did, I began to figure out that I was a secret and that he had another child. I never realized until much later that he was married when I was conceived.\n(Also to throw a complication in all this, my mom and I went to church since I was 2 years old. It wasn\u2019t until I figured things out that I realized the family we sat behind every Sunday, whose kids I was friends with were actually my Dads brother, sister-in-law and my cousins! They never knew and still do not).\n\nWhen I was a teen, my Dad and I would text often. He was always available. He was my voice of reason. He was amazing with words and with giving advice.\nAs an adult he continued to provide advice, he\u2019d babysit my kids or run my oldest to his drum lessons.\n\nBut he was still married with an older daughter and also a younger daughter he adopted many years later (because the older child always wanted a sister!).\n\nThen 2015 happened. I came home from a day out and my mom pulled up and I knew something was wrong. A lady from our church who knew the truth had called my mom to say a prayer email had gone out about my Dad. He had a massive heart attack and died suddenly. No chance to say goodbye, nothing. The funeral and obituary focused on how he was a loving husband and father of two girls. That hurt.\n\nSo what became his secret is now mine to hold and I don\u2019t know what to do with it. I longed to reach out to someone in the family but my Dad was such s respected Christian man, would I be destroying their image of him? And is it selfish of me to do that?\n\nI want to know my older sister. I know of her and she seems amazing! I want that connection to my Dad.\nI want them to know that although they didn\u2019t know it, he was a Grandpa and adored my three boys. I want to have some piece of him (via a connection to his family - not looking for money at all here!).\n\nI considered writing a letter to my Grandma for the longest time. I waited too long as she passed away this year. So now there is no one on his side that knows I exist as his child.\n\nAs much as I loved my Dad, I\u2019m also mad. I\u2019m mad he never told anyone about me. I\u2019m mad that I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye. I\u2019m mad that the feeling of not being good enough creeps up at times because I feel like if I was good enough he would have told people about me. Did I not make him proud? (I know that\u2019s about him, not me, but those feelings creep in sometimes.\n\nSo do I continue to hold this secret and feel like I\u2019m missing a piece of myself?

She then went on to make a lot of assumptions about my family saying they won\u2019t let me explore Christianity (even though my parents aren\u2019t very religious themselves) and that I can say whatever I want right now but at the end of the day I am the \u201chead of the household\u201d and I can tell my girlfriend to stop practicing her religion (which is quite an outdated mindset if you ask me)\n\nNow this is the part that really hurt me, she basically told my girlfriend she thinks she is \u201csettling\u201d and she could \u201cfind someone that loves her 3x more than I do\u201d. I know she could\u2019ve just said whatever in the heat of the moment but that shit hurt.\n\nFinally, the serious part of the conversation. She basically told my girlfriend that if my girlfriend continues seeing me, she will stop talking to my girlfriend all together. \n\nI am completely lost and have no idea what to do.\n\n\n\nA few things y\u2019all should know before commenting:\n\nI\u2019ve met her in person a few times but never really as my girlfriends \u201cboyfriend\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t resent her at all and I know she is thinking of my girlfriend\n\nI am open to converting eventually but I don\u2019t want to rush into things just to make my girlfriends mom happy. \n\nMy parents fully support our relationship\n\nPlease don\u2019t attack my girlfriends mom and be respectful."}, {"id": "ibsrv0", "n_comments": 17, "name": "Being short(24M) has ruined my confidence dating women. what can I do to fix this?", "text": "I have always been short my whole life.  I have no issue now when there's playful banter about my height like if my friends joke around, but one thing that always gets to me is that my short-stature affects my confidence when it comes to dating women, because it is seen as an undesirable trait.\n\nIt is pretty disparaging when you look at how many people prefer the taller male/shorter female relationship. I understand that there are many exceptions but it is an incredibly one sided preference. Obviously it is a preference similar to a significant other being unhealthy or obese but even obesity is not seen as more undesirable compared to height, people take height into more importance than weight (I assume since most can change their weight through a healthy lifestyle).\n\nI don't have any issue with most comments about my height. If you say that I am short, well obviously I am. Big deal if someone says I am short, its the comments like \"I couldn't date someone as short as you\" that hurts me, because it implies that I am not date-able because of my height. I understand that such people are horrible and i shouldn't have anything to do with them but it highlights how strong of a preference height is, and you cannot deny that it is a very strong preference.\n\nI know that what will really be more of a detriment is my lack of confidence because of my short-stature, not my short stature itself.

I hope you all understand. \n\nI (18f) was sexually assaulted by my cousin(21m) as a child, I was 14, and he was 17. I was in denial for many years but finally accepted it happened. I told my parents about it, but they weren\u2019t supportive and told me not to cause a drama because he was young when he did it. My parents' comments broke my heart, but it clearly showed me how toxic they are. \n\nSo there\u2019s this trend on TikTok where you pose as the person who sexually assaulted you. And my best friend suggested I do that. I really wanted to humiliate him so yeah I did it. Well, the video blew up, and he was harassed on Instagram by many people. I left his Instagram account. Someone who went to his university saw my video and reported it to the management. They kicked him out of the university and cancelled his scholarship. Some girls who were assaulted by him came forward with their stories too.\n\nMy family members (including relatives) are mad at me for ruining his life. They want me to apologise and tell his management that I lied for attention. I was against that idea, and my parents threatened to disown me. I honestly don\u2019t care about them. That cousin and his family members are also harassing me for doing this. My parents kicked me out of the house, and I\u2019m living with my boyfriend now. My friends, boyfriend and siblings are supporting me. My siblings even threatened my parents to leave me alone, or they would go no contact with them. My parents are pissed now because I ruined my cousin\u2019s life and also ruining their relationship with my siblings. Relatives that I  barely know are also harassing me.\n\nWhat do I do? All I did was to stand up for myself.\n\nEdit 1: wow this post blew up. First of all, I would like to thank everyone for your kind words and support. It is honestly so refreshing and heartwarming to see strangers supporting me. Thanks for the awards. Many of you all called me a hero, and I'm honestly speechless and very grateful. I would like to explain some things that I left out. \n\n1. I talked to my parents about this issue, but they disregarded it because my parents care more about family bonds. My mom told me to stop embarrassing myself by bringing up my story and forced me to attend family functions. He was still treated like a king by my parents, but I was mistreated. My parents told me that my bf would leave me if he knows this story because it was \u2018disgusting\u2019 and I was too afraid to tell him in the beginning. But he was very supportive and loved me even after I opened up. My parents also refused to give me therapy. I had no other choice because my own parents weren\u2019t supportive of me, and I wanted to protect the little cousins I had. \n\n2. I didn\u2019t post the video on TikTok for fame or attention. I posted it to ruin his life. He ruined mine, where i could not seek any help and was always hated my self, but he was still happy had everything and even acted as nothing happened. And like most of you all said many girls were also victims, and the video gave them the strength to open up.\n\n3. for people asking me to explain how he sexually assaulted me- fuck you all!\n\n4. if you think it\u2019s fake I honestly don\u2019t know what to tell. \n\n5. I am not sure about the police report. But I would consider that and meet up with the other girls and talk about it. \n\nAs for now, I\u2019m really happy with my bf and friends. I would definitely meet up with a therapist for my mental health. \n\nAgain thank you very much, everyone.

We realized we enjoyed spending time together and feelings emerged. \n\nHe\u2019s met my friends a while ago and I always invite him to hang out with two of my closest friends (one girl and one guy both single). They both play frisbee and Daniel loves frisbee so I suggested they all play together and they started to do that more often without me (I don\u2019t mind as they tend to I invite me but I\u2019m usually busy working when they go). \n\nLast weekend we took a trip upstate to go camping and hiking and I felt like Daniel really got to know my friends a lot better. There was even this one point in the car when him and my girl friend - let\u2019s call her Jess, had an intimate conversation that dominated the car as no one else was talking for almost an hour. The questions he asked her were extremely personal and vice versa to the point I realized that he had never even asked me any of those questions. \n\nI felt some type of way afterwards but thought it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and I was maybe a little jealous. A few days later me and Daniel were alone and reflecting on the trip as he mentioned how cool my friends were and how he should hang out with them more since they are my friends. First he mentioned how he should hang out with my guy friend but then brought up how cool Jess was and how he should hang out with her too. \n\nA few days later they all played frisbee (I wasn\u2019t invited and I\u2019m not sure they even knew I was working) and I found out about it after the fact. That same night Daniel took a little longer to answer my texts after they all played some late night frisbee, and I\u2019m not sure what he was doing up so late to begin with. The next day I found out they all had dinner together after frisbee but I\u2019m not sure what happened afterwards and he never told me. That same next day we went to the supermarket and I forget what he was saying but as he reached in to randomly hug me he called me Jess and didn\u2019t even notice or correct himself. I didn\u2019t bring it up right then and there because I was so shocked. We parted ways shortly after that and I avoided a goodbye kiss and biked ahead of him without saying much as he dropped me home. He texted me shortly after asking if I was upset and I told him how he called me my friends name and didn\u2019t even notice and how weird that was for me. He apologized and told me he didn\u2019t realize but that it didn\u2019t mean anything and he wanted to talk to me but I\u2019m just extremely puzzled and think the whole thing is bizarre. \n\nWhat does this mean? Am I crazy to feel so sad or upset by this? Personally I don\u2019t think calling someone another name by mistake is that big of a deal and my parents do it all the time with my sister and me. But I think this usually happens when you spend enough time with the two people equally and feel the same way about them. It could also happen if they have similar sounding names or are in the same place at the same time. Neither of those things hold true. I\u2019ve called Daniel and my other friend - let\u2019s call him David the other by mistake once or twice but only because they have similar sounding names and only when we were all hanging out together. I\u2019ve also caught myself and corrected myself immediately anytime that happened. They\u2019ve only hung out a few times and it was just extremely bizarre to me that he didn\u2019t even catch it and did it during such a intimate act.\n\nCurious to know if I\u2019m justified in feeling the way I do."}, {"id": "ib8eqi", "n_comments": 111, "name": "I JUST discovered that my boyfriend deliberately folds up empty snack/trash/garbage and TUCKS IT INTO MY COUCH!", "text": "This is really freaking me out. Now, I am currently a bit tipsy and am posting this because my Google search has failed me, or I have probably failed it by my absurd question phrasing, but I have been noticing for the past year that cleaning out my couch has been the Olympic event of my 2020. I have swept out crumbs, vacuumed relentless snacks and missing food, as well as removing never ending garbage from food wrappers to empty snack cakes, chip bags, etc. I never thought any of it was intentional.\n\nI guess I have to admit that before my boyfriend and I were dating, he was a bit of a slob. However when I demanded clean he would make it happen. I always chalked it up to laziness which I cannot penalize him for because dishes are the bane of my existence. His truck was always a mess though he did a good clean at least once a month. I just figured as a bachelor he was living his best life without anyone else to care about until he needed it.\n\nSo back to the dilemma, I reached into the couch looking deeply for my remote control and found a folded neatly and tucked deeply empty chip bag, which we have not had those chips in the house for about 2 months now. Anytime before this I always assumed that his high ass just left empty wrappers on the couch and they found their futures tucked between my cushions. Seriously,  it happened more often than not in our house from personal experiece.\nI may not have approached the situation with the proper technique considering I am many beers into my night, but when I confronted him as politely as I could muster, he avoided the question then yelled at me for being drunk and trying to start a fight. I asked him a few more times and all I got was, \"Yeah sure I am just crazy!\" And then accused again of being drunk and wanting to fight. I told him I would bring it up again in the morning sober and he \"took the dare.\"  He is still completely avoiding my question as to just simply... why?\n\nWhy would anyone have this behavior or what in their past would create this behavior? I am so sure I embarrassed him but I feel freaking played cleaning up his out of sight mess over and over and knowing this was never normal behavior? Has anyone ever experienced a situation and coped with it? Or maybe some advice to ask about the root of the situation? I want to describe it as a problem but I know how that feels. \nCan anyone chime in to just give me a little insight? I have never been with anyone like this before and I am afraid that it confirms my suspicion of him literally being a lazy slob to his own environment.

Though I have enjoyed all of the advice and conversations today, and upon getting some insight into different views of issues, I am sure I have come to a few conclusions of the future.\n\nI brought up the question again to him this evening, still got the same ridiculous defense. So I just let him have this one. No more asking. Just gonna try a few tips first and then reach an outcome. \n\nAddressing a few things, I NO LONGER have a rodent problem. I worked really hard the last 2 years to accomplish that. \n\nI was never trying to stereotype all contractor people. I live in an area where you do not need a license to do contracting work. That makes it so much easier for undesirables like ex cons, people who do drugs, people who can't get jobs, and a lot of them get paid up front and dip out from jobs before they are done or realize they are in over their heads and cannot complete the job or lack the knowledge. Now it does help out a few of those people get out of ruts and reform and keep the bills paid so it is not the worst for everyone, people just know out here what to try and avoid. Hope that clears that up a little. I am tired of defending that. Take it or leave it. \n\nAlso I still love the guy and am not quite the up and out kind of person. So I will try a few tricks and tips first before I need to get the hell out. But thank you for confirming my being wary of how it could turn out. \n\nThanks Internet!

They all make a great deal of money from it and split the income. During COVID my BF lost his job, all of his money and investments, and his future - in June he used around 500 of the Airbnb income from the family pool  for personal expenses when he did not get a stimulus check from the Italian government yet, thinking it would be no problem because he's receive the money from the government soon. However Italy has a reputation for being super slow and he never received the money and began to panic about how to return the 500 to his parents.\n\nHe went onto a betting/stocks website and bet the money, just enough to repay everything and also improve his life. He's done this in the past and was quite smart/made a good amount of money from it but hasn't for years. Everything was going great, but he took ONE bet and lost everything in an instant. The night he found out he was a complete wreck, more upset than I've ever seen him, thinking his life was over. His parents were going to help him renovate a house he owns so he can make a great deal of income from that, as well as BUY him a new house for 200,000 or so - his life was about to finally pick up again and he thinks if they found out they would do nothing to support him and he would lose his most ambitious opportunities. I do see this as a red flag, however I also know he is a kind man and i've never seen anyone more scared, depressed or helpless, he truly lost everything with COVID and life was picking up again and it fell apart (due to his own crazy mistake). Before COVID he was a successful professional basketball player (canceled due to the virus danger), invested in houses and stocks and had lots of money and came off as very responsible.\n\nHere's the problem: His parents know something is up and they are expecting their check from Airbnb soon, within days, which he usually deposits directly into their Paypal, and he's out of time to try to turn the mistake around.\n\nWe have done everything to make money to solve the problem. His parents are selling his childhood mansion and giving him 100% of income from selling furniture and household items, including Mont Blanc fountain pens, gold, expensive antiques. (His family sounds rich but they are not, Italian families sometimes just have lots of family homes) We have tried selling the household items and succeeded on some, however it takes time we don't have. He has tried taking out personal loans. I loaned him 400 bucks the other day so he can give his mom \\*something\\* for now (he paid me back two days later, he's not gold-digging me). Anyway, now we only have one option - I have to try to get a personal loan MYSELF in the US and have my parents cosign, but I will have to come up with a reason outside of the truth to get them to cosign, because obviously they wouldn't jump to help my BF. I need extra money because my school loans already don't cover tuition, but I'd basically give this to my BF til he gets paid in September and he'd pay me back within the month.\n\nEDIT: Comments coming up indicating sketchy behavior - Italy is very different than the US. No credit scores, terrible taxes, outrageous unemployment. He has money invested in stocks with his bank and attempted to remove them, but at the time it was only worth 1000 euro and the bank recommended he wait to remove it. He owns one car which he drives to work and can not sell. Theres no level of \"unemployment\" the way there is in the US, there's sooo many unemployed Italian citizens (he wasn't one of them before the virus, but Italy does not offer unemployment). He did receive 1800 from the Italian government, coming in two installments. He received the first and the second never arrived, hence his first decision to use 500 from the family Airbnb pool, thinking the money would show up soon. But Italy is kind of a mess and really unreliable so this stuff really takes FOREVER. \n\nNow I'm wondering where the line is between being a supportive girlfriend and getting involved in a dysfunctional situation. I can't tell if I am being selfish by having doubts or if i'm being smart. I know he'd pay me back and he hates taking money from me. I also know his life has fallen apart due to the virus, and Italy works differently than the US, so me getting a loan to fix this mess is more likely. However part of me wonders if it isn't my responsibility to help him fix his big mistake? Obviously he made a huge, somewhat morally-wrong mistake, and I feel uncomfortable getting myself, and my parents, involved to fix it? If I did get a cosigned loan I know without a doubt I could pay it in full within a month due to his income and selling the entire house, but still?! My mind feels really confused - I love him a lot and see a serious future with him and I know he's been through hell, especially now, and I know he's really scared. Is it messed up for me to think he's wrong for not handling it with integrity and telling his parents the truth? Or am I just not understanding because if they knew the truth his life would get even worse instead of finally improving for the better? Any input, and clarity, is welcome.\n\nTL;DR BF Lost his career and money to COVID and has done some desperate things to get the money back, using his parents AirBnb income to help him with expenses, and now he's in a big mess where he lost the money to bets in an act of desperation, leaving our only option after expending every single one, for me to ask my parents to cosign a loan, or leave him to tell his parents and potentially blow up his life when he already thinks this is the worst moment of his life because of whats happened already."}, {"id": "ibsd91", "n_comments": 4, "name": "The more I do stuff without my girlfriend, the more I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with her.", "text": "Going into my [20] senior year of college with my girlfriend [21].

But how do you suggest I get rid of any doubts I\u2019m having and continue with the relationship?"}, {"id": "ibqjeg", "n_comments": 9, "name": "My [19F] dad [52M] told me that I'm ugly and that my boyfriend[20M] is no good?", "text": "**---------------------TLDR is at the  bottom--------------------**\n\nMy 20m boyfriend and I have been together since January. When COVID-19 started getting bad in March, I moved back home from college to live with my dad. My dad knows about my bf but hasn't met him in person. Since then, my bf and I have mostly kept in touch through text and we face time about once every 3 weeks. Recently my dad has taken a keen interest in who I spend time on calls with (since I don't do it very often).\n\nLast weekend my bf and I talked for about an hour in call. I enjoy talking with him and we always have fun, so the hour usually flies by. During the call, my bf spent the first 20 min asking me about how I was and mostly keeping the focus of the conversation on me. I reciprocated for the next 20min and for the last 20 we just goofed off and talked about ridiculous things.\n\nAfter the call, my dad\\[52m\\] asked me what I had *learned* from my bf. I was confused, because I said all we did was catch up and had some fun. I told him that bf asked about me for about 20min and I did the same. Then my dad said \"why would your bf spend 20 min asking about you? He doesn't sound like a good guy. He's trying to use you.\"\n\nI was kind of shocked. My dad then went on to say, \"I think he's trying to get information from you. You need  to be careful. He's your competitor.\" (bf and I are in a competitive major, but literally the only thing we'd ever be competing for is a job...and there's plenty of jobs in my major)\n\nAt this point, I'm very confused because I thought my bf was being the same kind soul he always is. He talked with me about my summer classes even though I'm sure he was bored because he had already taken them. I tried to explain to my dad that my bf was a super sweet and kind guy, and he likely didn't mean any harm by talking to me about my classes. I then tried to back up my evidence by telling him that my best friend (who was the one that introduced me to my bf) has known him a long time and also considers him a sweet and kind person.\n\nMy best friend \\[19f\\] is an amazing person. She's gorgeous, fun, smart, and outgoing. So when I told my dad that my best friend said my bf is kind, my dad calmly said, **\"he's probably nice to her because she's beautiful and he's interested in her. You? You're not pretty like her. You're kind of ugly. Boys like to be nice to pretty girls.\"**\n\nNow it's not so much the comment that stings; I KNOW my best friend is gorgeous and I'm happy for her about it. But my bf is also extremely handsome, smart, and funny, and I've always felt the slightest bit insecure that he could get a much better girlfriend than me. However, I don't think I let it affect me because I thought I was just being negative about myself. But now that my dad also notices, I'm feeling anxious about this now.\n\nMy best friend and my bf are pretty close friends, but she's in a relationship right now. After my dad made that comment, it's like he planted a seed in my head. Before I go insane, can you guys let me know what you think to set me straight? This conversation isn't a sign of my bf just \"using\" me right?\n\nI'm not sure who I should talk to about this either. Do I have a discussion about this with my best friend? My boyfriend? My dad?\n\n**TLDR; My dad essentially told me I'm not pretty enough for my boyfriend and that my best friend is. My bf and my best friend have been good friends for longer than I've been dating my bf, but now I'm starting to wonder if I should be concerned about anything?**"}, {"id": "ibrk3a", "n_comments": 9, "name": "I (29F) think I might be in an abusive relationship and I'm very embarrassed and scared", "text": "I never thought I would be in a situation like this. Im not even sure how to explain it to myself, much less anyone else. He's never laid a hand on me. He swears, but only occasionally. More so lately. But no one else in the world knows how to turn me into a sobbing pile of tears like he does. Make me feel like a pathetic child, a crazy, irrational, hysterical woman. No one else knows how to make me feel like I need to throw up just through speaking alone. I cant even tell you what he says. He doesnt even call me awful names. But no one else else makes me look in the mirror and see what a sad excuse for a person I've become. I deeply miss who I used to be.\n\nI feel like I let it get so far because I can't point to one thing and say \"this was when it crossed the line,\" he just says things with such contempt, and he's just able to twist things so somehow I'm the bad one, I'm the awful one crying on the kitchen floor, even now, manipulating him with my tears.\n\nI can't be crazy, right?

I even planned on asking her to marry me. So to the issue, since the state I live in has gone into quarantine my girlfriend has been on unemployment after losing her job. She had been making more on unemployment than she had with her job so I encouraged her to stay on unemployment until our state starts to open up again or that the benefits diminish. She had been making enough money to pay her bills, buy groceries (I pay the mortgage and utilities) and she even had enough left over for fun money. However as of August she had only been making enough to barely keep her pills paid and the bare minimum on groceries. I asked her if she had planned on applying for a job to which she rejected saying that she will receive more money once she recertifies. The time came for her to recertify and after doing so tells me that it will take 21 days to know if she qualifies for anymore compensation. After hearing this I told her that I believe that it's best that she starts looking for a job like where I work since I know that we are always hiring and are considered essential. She doesn't respond to me at all and so I left it alone since she considers when ever I talk to her about job searching as nagging so I try not to bring it up more than once during a financial conversation. Hours pass and as I'm coming home on my lunch break as I do she tells me that she talked to a friend of hers (we will call him mark) that since her works for food stamps that she should apply to help pay for groceries. I think that a good idea but then asked about how she would cover her bills. That's when she says that she had been talking to mark about the idea that I should postpone my mortgage payments for at least 2 months to help pay for her bills and groceries and to save the rest until she finds out if she will be reinstated for unemployment. I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that and it caused a big argument. I had to leave for work and told her we would talk about it later. She decides to call me while I'm at work to scold me for not immediately agreeing to help her. I told her that I am still not comfortable with the idea but would be willing to postpone my payments under the terms that she looks for a job. She tells me that she has no intentions in getting a job until our state goes into phase 3, we are still in phase 2 with no signs of moving forward. In fact we are more likely to turn back to phase one. When I told her this she said she wasnt risking getting a job that would cause her to be at risk for covid. So I told her to look into remote work since I had a tech support job lined up and was just waiting for a call back. She told me no and that she had no interest in getting a job and is now ignoring my messages. I'm not comfortable postponing my mortgage if she isn't willing to find a job, what should I do? \n\nTLDR: my girlfriend wants me to stop my mortgage payments to pay her to be a house wife."}, {"id": "ibsyx9", "n_comments": 5, "name": "Best Friend Went to Zero Contact Out of Nowhere and Insists That Nothing\u2019s Wrong", "text": "Obligatory mobile post warning.\n\nI\u2019m (21F) a senior in college in my last semester. This is our first week back, and I\u2019m experiencing the first drama of my college career that includes who is now I guess my ex-best friend who we\u2019ll call May (21F). Ever since freshman year I was in a trio friend group with May and Gwen (21F). We were basically inseparable. We would have times where two of us were closer than the other, but it would always change and no one felt like they were being excluded. \n\nI think it would also be worth mentioning that May got a boyfriend, who is not a great guy. He would try to micromanage his previous girlfriends to an unhealthy degree. Gwen and I warned May of this, but she went ahead with the relationship. Ever since then, we haven\u2019t spoken a bad word about him (to her) to try and be supportive. \n\nEver since we were sent home for quarantine, May has basically been radio silent, even with the rest of our friend group. We would Zoom every Saturday to have a game night. May was always invited, but never joined in the 5 months we did it, she always had weak excuses (I\u2019m eating dinner at 8:30pm or hanging out with my family). She would FaceTime with just Gwen and I, and she always seemed normal when it was just the three of us. She would also go hours or days before replying to our texts. We assumed that it was just covid related stuff, so we decided to let it be, and thought things would get back to normal when we got to school. \n\nMay and Gwen got back to campus last week because they\u2019re RA\u2019s, and Gwen said that May said one thing to her the whole time, and wouldn\u2019t make eye contact or acknowledge her at all for the rest of their training. I got back to campus early as I\u2019ll only be there for one semester and experienced the same thing. We would literally be sitting at the table right next to her and she wouldn\u2019t even look at us. She started hanging out with a completely new set of people (along with her boyfriend) as well. We have a class together, and she sat on the completely opposite side of the room, even though there were open (socially distanced) seats near me. \n\nGwen and I decided that we would talk with her about her being MIA. I\u2019m more blunt than Gwen is, so we decided that she should start, but she got nervous, so I took the lead. \n\nI told her that we haven\u2019t seen her at all and asked if she\u2019d been avoiding us. Guys, she turned into a statue, and had no emotion for the rest of the conversation until the very end. She immediately started saying that friendship was a two-way street and how she couldn\u2019t be expected to reach out all the time. I honestly don\u2019t remember the last time she initiated a meeting. It\u2019s all been on mine and Gwen\u2019s initiate, which gets tiring after a while. \n\nShe also said that it\u2019s only the first day of school, which would\u2019ve been reasonable if she hadn\u2019t been here for a week already. We asked her if we had done anything, she said no. We asked her if she had even noticed that she wasn\u2019t talking to us, and she said no. May said that she\u2019s just been way too busy, and we pointed out that she\u2019s hung out with other people, and that it\u2019s not hard to just wave at people. We told her that we were hurt by her ignoring us and she asked us \u201cwhat, do you want me to pay more attention to you in public?\u201d Yes? Is that a weird thing to ask of a friend all of a sudden? She said that all three of us should make more of an effort to maintain the friendship. \n\nThis part kinda pissed me off the most. At the end of the conversation where nothing was resolved, May just went \u201chave a good night!!!\u201d in a really chipper voice that was a total 180 from the robot who was standing in her place before. It was the fake May that\u2019s been making more and more of an appearance. \n\nGwen and I are angry and sad. Neither of us feel like we can continue in a friendship with her while she is being so rude and dismissive towards us. She obviously can\u2019t be herself around us anymore, which is heartbreaking. It really became toxic at the end. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how to feel about her anymore. We were SUPER close, she was one of the people who I thought would be with me throughout my entire life. If she came to her senses and came back to Gwen and I, would it be a stupid idea to welcome her back? Should we just ignore all future contact with her? I don\u2019t know how to disentangle myself from her in a way that would be the least painful."}, {"id": "ibfpzn", "n_comments": 23, "name": "Roommate needs a long recovery surgery, doesn't want to pay rent or move out", "text": "Hello!

But instead of completely moving he just wants to leave his stuff in his room, which makes it so we can't rent out the room to other people. My fiance, I, and our other roommate can't really cover his rent for the 2 to 3 months or longer he plans on being away, and he has not brought forward any ideas on payment.

My husband and I (Both 27M) have always had a heated relationship. I wouldn\u2019t say it was happening more than it does in any relationship, and there was never any time when things turned physical. We always managed to work through it. We were married last year, and have been together for four years total.\n\nIn May, we were involved in a car accident involving a drunk driver. No serious injuries thankful, but the car was totaled, both of us were out of work until late July, and I am still going through physical therapy for my injuries. This has become a source of arguments for us, as we are both aware that we will not be considering a settlement with insurance until all medical treatment is completed. There have been several remarks from my husband that I am clearly fine, don\u2019t need physical therapy anymore and that I am allowing the physical therapist to \u201cmilk us dry\u201d. I left work early this past Saturday because the pain was too much for me to handle. \n\nAt the end of July, we took my husbands dog to the vet because she had lost some significant weight. She had, it turns out, lost twenty pounds and developed an infection. Blood work was completed, and it was discovered that she was diabetic. The vet mainly spoke with my husband, who relayed information to me. I ended up calling the vet myself, who told me more or less the same thing. However, one thing the vet told both of us and my husband had not mentioned, was that vet herself did not consider herself strong enough to go through treating a dog for diabetes, and that she felt like euthanasia was option.\n\nThis dog has been a part of my husbands life three times as long as I have. He was homeless for a period and protected on at least two occasions from other meaning to harm him by this dog. I understand why he chose not to tell me that the vet had discussed putting his dog down, but I was upset that he refused to even consider it as an option and was becoming upset with me for even bringing it up. This has become another argument for us, despite myself trying to explain that I had a dog in high school that had to be put down and I fully understand the emotional toll. He likes to say I have given up on her. I myself paid for the first visit which discovered her diabetes, and then for the initial glucose curve. I also told my husband I would pay for that much, but from there he needed to get back to work and start paying for it himself, as I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t agree with his choice not to put her down. \n\nOn top of all this, we\u2019ve been trying to find a new vehicle. We rented a car for three weeks which exhausted our savings, and have been borrowing a family members vehicle. I have been car shopping alone which has sparked remarks about us not having enough for financing, wasting our time and similar negative comments. Additionally, he has been accusing me of \u201conly being happy when the car is on my possession\u201d by throwing a fit whenever he has the vehicle. I have been \u201charassing\u201d him about returning to work but do not allow him to take the car, and consider my own job so important that I would pick my job over him. \n\nI work full time as a manager in a retail environment. Our health insurance is through my employer. And I did, in fact, provide him with my own work schedule from the beginning of the month through last Saturday, so that he could share it with his employer and at the very least work his job on my days off. He did not share it with them.\n\nSo this morning it all kinda boiled over. I\u2019m allowing my \u201cdainty little knee\u201d to keep us from settling with the insurance, I don\u2019t care about his dog by refusing to pay for the insulin that he can\u2019t pay for because he has only worked 1 day a week for the last month, I had made arrangements last week to go visit family out of town and go car shopping today but he told me around 10 this morning he was taking the car to go to work. I ended up canceling those plans and let him take the car, but I told him it was ridiculous that he continued to blame me for his not working when he has not had an actual schedule, he gets a text/call between 9 and 10 in the morning, when I\u2019m usually already at work, and blames me for not being able to get there.\n\nHe called while he was on his break. We started arguing again, I guess he spoke with his mom about purchasing insulin. Whatever she said, he was pissed with me again for refusing to help buy the insulin (which I do not even have the funds to do. We have been living paycheck to paycheck for the last month and a half, and he\u2019s fully aware of that) so he proceeded to lay into me about not being a good husband, not caring for him or the dog. I cut him short there and told him that I do care for them both but the dog doesn\u2019t have any sort of quality life now and should have been put down.\n\nHe left work, came home and packed some things. I drove him and the dog into town to his brothers and left. He cried the whole ride. I didn\u2019t shed a single tear. He told me I was heartless, I told him that I was tired of being blamed. He says that\u2019s not what he intends, but I have told him before. I don\u2019t care for him dismissing my injury, I don\u2019t care for being \u201cresponsible\u201d for why he can\u2019t work, I don\u2019t care for the (possibly inadvertent) blame game he has been playing.\n\nHe has been calling and text on and off since.

We both see each other as best friends, but when we have disagreements, it usually ends poorly.\n\nWe had some arguments basically as soon as we started dating, but our first major and explosive argument was in April. I was visiting him for a few days and was having a depressive episode. I mostly laid in his bed all day while he played video games. I told him I was feeling bad and was hoping he would show me some affection or offer some support as a kind gesture, but I didn\u2019t voice that to him. So, later on that night when we were in bed, I told him that I would really appreciate it if he showed me more affection sometimes. He took this as a personal attack and started yelling without warning. He told me that he\u2019s sweet to me all the time, but I just can\u2019t see that because I don\u2019t know how to manage my emotions. I felt really hurt and knew a productive talk was unlikely, so I just told him that I wasn\u2019t trying to start an argument and said goodnight. He kept going on though, calling me emotionally inept, and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to date someone like you.\u201d So, I just got up and left the room to sleep on the couch. I was extremely saddened by what he said. I recognized that what he was doing was a defense mechanism to protect himself, but I knew I didn\u2019t deserve to be treated that way. When I woke up the next morning, I still felt sad but now it was mostly just anger. I told him that what he said to me wasn\u2019t okay at all, and he responded with things like \u201cyou need to go therapy\u201d and \u201cyou obviously don\u2019t care about mental health as much as you say, or you would have just meditated like I told you to do (he\u2019s a hardcore believer in mediation, and while I tried it, I didn\u2019t have a strict regimen like he wanted me to have). But you won\u2019t do either of those things because you have a superiority complex and you can\u2019t do what someone tells you to do.\u201d That\u2019s not verbatim, but you get the idea. I tried to defend myself by saying that I want to go to therapy, but I can\u2019t because I don\u2019t have insurance and I\u2019m a poor college student; he knows that. I tried to tell him that I am trying to meditate, but he would just roll his eyes. I really just wanted an apology from him and to acknowledge that what he did was hurtful, but he was 100% convinced that I was the sole cause of this problem and I just lacked so much self-awareness that I couldn\u2019t see it. My mind just felt like mush. On one hand, I felt confident that what I had said last night didn\u2019t deserve his reaction, but on the other hand, I kept thinking \u201cwhat if he\u2019s right? What if I just have no emotional regulation or self awareness?\u201d So I eventually bowed down to him and apologized, but he was still livid. I decided to leave and go back home, and he texted me an hour later apologizing for some of the stuff he did. It wasn\u2019t a great apology, but I accepted it anyways.\n\nOne of the main problems in the relationship was that he would either ignore me or get angry if I tried to talk about something that was bothering me... like if I asked for more affection, like the previous example. For the last 2 months, we have been arguing almost everyday over text (since we live about 2 hours apart). I\u2019ve been trying to tell him that I haven\u2019t been feeling like he listens to me for probably 5 months now, but it\u2019s to not avail. I try my best to be respectful and gentle about it when I bring it up, since I know it\u2019s a touchy conversation, but like I said, I\u2019m either ignored or he lashes out. I\u2019ve asked him if he would consider therapy a month ago, and he said he would try, but he hasn\u2019t even looked for a therapist yet. So, after seemingly 100s of arguments later, a couple days ago... I told him I wanted to talk seriously.\n\nI was gonna tell him that if things keep going the way they are and that he doesn\u2019t at least try therapy, that I would need to leave to focus on my own health. I started off the conversation with saying \u201cI want to talk about something seriously but I\u2019m worried that you might get angry.\u201d He assured me that he would listen, so I started to type out my message. Before I could finish, he sent me, \u201cactually my friend is in town so I\u2019m gonna go hang out with him and some other people.\u201d I told him, \u201cactually the timing is pretty bad, and it\u2019s kind of upsetting.\u201d He said, \u201cyou can text it all to me and I\u2019ll answer when I have the time. Or would you rather me stay home and talk about it now?\u201d I told him that I\u2019d rather talk about it now, since it was serious and I needed some answers. So I started typing out my message again... then he says, \u201cmy friends have been waiting a long time, so I\u2019m gonna go now, ttyl\u201d Again, I say, \u201cthis is pretty frustrating because I haven\u2019t felt listened to in a long time\u201d He responds with, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t need to be so black and white. I wouldn\u2019t be upset if the roles switched and you had plans. I tried to compromise but this is taking a long time and they\u2019re waiting. So I\u2019m gonna go now\u201d I felt so extremely frustrated... even though the situation was probably just unfortunate timing, it still felt like all the months of the same failed communication over and over again. Not to mention, I have put aside what I'm doing to focus on him when he needed me before many times in the past... so I honestly wanted the same treatment. I didn\u2019t want to endure it anymore so I just told him over text that I wanted to break up to focus on myself. I knew it was wrong to break up with him over text, but I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\n\nThe next day, he was pretty angry with me. He said that breaking up over text was bullshit and that this was all a reminder of how emotionally reactive I am and how I lack the self-awareness he has been \u201ccraving.\u201d I told him I was sorry for not calling and that I was willing to call now to make it right, and we could talk about what happened. He said he didn\u2019t want to call at first because he was too angry, so I waited about 5 hours and then he agreed to a phone call. I tried to explain that I know it seemed reactive, but this was a build up of all the problems we haven\u2019t addressed, and about how I have felt unheard for months and just wanted a piece of his time. He said \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and that my explanation didn\u2019t make any sense to him and that it wouldn\u2019t make sense to anybody. He was 100% convinced that this was just an isolated event where I felt upset and wanted to fix my own distress by breaking up because that was the easiest thing to do. It didn\u2019t matter what I said because if I tried to defend myself, it would just affirm his belief that I\u2019m not self-aware. He then said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on the phone for a long time, I just don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d So I said goodbye and we hung up.\n\nI feel really hurt because I still care about him and I didn\u2019t want our last interaction to be so full of anger. I know I messed up by texting him, but I wish he was willing to see my side. I want to believe that what I\u2019m saying makes sense, but when he\u2019s so convinced that I\u2019m just reactive and confusing... it makes me think that maybe I have been in the wrong all along and that I shouldn\u2019t have broken up with him. It\u2019s all so messy and I really don\u2019t know how to feel, or if my decision was justified in that moment."}, {"id": "ibugmb", "n_comments": 4, "name": "My [30m] Girlfriend [30f]'s landlord [30m] is acting like crazy because he's in love with my GF, but she's seeing me.", "text": "Ok. \nHe moved her in a year ago. I was not comfortable with it because, he obviously was showing signs he was interested in her. I met her a month before she moved in with this guy. \n\nWhenever I would visit, he would act weird. I wasn't comfortable being around him, because he was just... weird..\n\nBegan to show erradict behavior here and there. Started being a dick to my girlfriend. I offered to talk to him many times, but she declined, didn't want her \"living situation\" to be messed up. He would get on her about cleaning the apartment, etc. \n\nAnyway, Valentines day comes. I pick her up. Roomate / landlord sees us leaving together. She had just bought a car (and old toyota) - so we were going to take a drive around the block in it, as it was parked in the apartment parking space.\n\n Speeds up in his sports car, and walks to my car and mumbles some bullshit like, \"Pull forward, then move out.\" (It was his half-assed way of giving me directions on how to leave the apartment complex?)\n\nAfter we leave, she gets a text. It's a love poem from him. Mind you, she's been living there for about 4 months. She freaks out and says \"I have to move now!!!\" - situation gets a little escalated, nothing happens though.  I was about to turn around, confront him, but she asks me not to. Doesn't want a fight to happen. \n\nThe next day, he apologizes profusely and things seemed to be normal for a while. He minded his own business. She minded hers. I would pick her up on the weekends. (I pick her up every weekend)\n\nOne day, I was on her FB looking at her photos and notice she added him on facebook. I got pissed, because she never adds \"other guys\" on her facebook. She said \"He added me, and kept asking me if I would add him, so I Did.\"  - I messaged him on FB about it. Basically confronted him about the poem, and adding her etc. \n\nThat was back in march, then Covid hits, and things seem normal after that. I continue seeing her every weekend for 5 months. He seemed to act normal, but occasionally he would do something weird. One time he was making rings, and asked her \"What her size was.\" - and she freaked out. \n\nAt this point you're wondering, why is she living there in the first place? It's close to her work and she is within walking distance to all the resources she needs. (Bus stops etc, she doesn't have a license yet... ((I know she has a car but not a license))) - ANyway, we started looking for places but... her credit is bad and landlords are VERY picky for who they take in. So it's been hard to find her another place. \n\nThat being said. He started to act weird again, after being cool for like 4 months. First it was the ring thing, then, whenever she would get back from seeing me, he would be a dick to her for no reason. He started getting used to having her around, I guess to clean the house. Strange thing is, he rents out the other rooms to only females. \n\nI always had an edgy feeling every time I picked her up from apartment, mainly because the guy is weird and doesn't communicate right. Recently, he came outside to his car and confronted me about the Facebook message I sent him. (Which was literally like 5 months ago.) - \n\nHe comes outside and says \"SUP\" to me. (I was waiting for my Gf to get her stuff.) \n\nI look at him, and he turns his head and gets in his car and rolls the window up. So I just turned away, ignoring him again, because I know there is tension. Finally he drives his car up to my car real slow, and rolls his window down. Says..\n\n\"Next time you want to talk to me about something, say it to my face, don't go on facebook blah bla blah..\"\n\nSo I stick my head out the window and I said \"Ok. Lets talk now.\" I say. \n\nHe says \"I said all I needed to say.\" and speeds off in his car. LOL.\n\nI say Whatever, and my gf comes out after that. She says \"What happened?\" I tell her. She's like \"OMG WTF.\" \n\nAnyway. \n\nShe stays with me for the week, and I drop her off. She says \"Maybe you should drop me off somewhere else because he's being weird.\" - I say \"Nah. We are adults. We shouldn't have to hide from this jackass, whom you are paying rent to.\" \n\nAnyway, So I park in front of her house and let her get her stuff, because we are going to go somewhere again. I get out of my car, and I shake hands with the neighbors, and their family and kids. My gf comes out of the apartment to join me and we are talking to the neighbors. I'm mainly doing it to show that, I'm not afraid of this guy and he needs to see that, I am her boyfriend, in case he forgot.\n\nAt that moment, her room-mate / landlord pulls up again in his vehicle. Appearantly he didn't like the site of me shaking hands with his neighbors with my GF, so he must have freaked out. \n\nLater My GF gets a text saying. \"I think you should move in with your MAN. I don't want to be JUST friends with you anymore. I have been thinking a lot...etc.\"\n\nSo he keeps telling her \"We need to talk in person.\" - He is sending her these texts while I'm with her. She is showing me the texts and saying. \"Great now what?\"\n\nAt around that time, Landlord removes my GF as a friend on facebook, and changes his profile picture to a bunch of \"burning skulls\" and flames. No jokes. Like he's emotionally damaged or some shit.\n\nAnyway, he said he will talk to her when she gets back. So this left us wondering what in the fuck he wants. See, he had been threatening to kick her out before, mainly because he doesnt like her seeing me. He said that she's \"going backwards\" because of me. LOL.\n\nAnyway, I told her, look, if I need to move you in, or whatever, we'll figure something out. We'll handle it. Anyway. She spends the weekend with me, and I drop her back off at her place again.\n\nLO' and BEHOLD. Instead of having a \"Talk\" with her. He shows up with another woman. Appearantly, another \"ugly\" woman and introducers this woman to her. We both were like.. wtf? \n\nSo now, instead of having the \"Talk\" with her, he says \"I have more important things to attend to at the moment.\" - etc. He's been gone from his apartment for the first time in A YEAR. And has been hanging around this new woman, who we think is some kind of prostitute or drug addict based on her appearance.\n\nI just told her, whatever it is he has to say, you need to get out of there.

He\u2019s meeting mine for the first time, which is larger, so I can understand how that is overwhelming. When we are at my dads house he just sits on his phone the whole time playing a game on his phone...it\u2019s getting to the point where my family comments on it (to me) and actually think he\u2019s a quite person who doesn\u2019t talk much, which isn\u2019t true. I don\u2019t think they care about the whole phone thing, but for me, it\u2019s embarrassing/I wasn\u2019t raised to think that sitting on my phone while visit people was a proper thing to. I brought this up to him, because he tends to play this game a l o t, so I asked him to put it down please and slipped in how my family has commented on it. I will admit i was a bit annoyed that he was playing so my words may have caused him to become extremely defensive. I asked him why he sits on his phone around my family and he just responded \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to do\u201d \u201cwhat am i supposed to do\u201d. Then, he brought up how he doesn\u2019t want to speak up and say anything dumb, or be attacked (my family is extremely sarcastic, will address soon) and he was saying how my dad isn\u2019t the best person to talk to. My dad is covered in tattoos and is a stereotyping OG. He can be a dick sometimes, but you can never say he isn\u2019t a good father. I explained to my bf how everyone\u2019s personality is just sarcastic and roasty, basically just told him to go with the flow and to seriously not take offense to anything.

And at the end of the day, he is and always will be considered family...when i said that he immediately said \u201cno, I\u2019m not\u201d. Idk i kept trying to tell him to just make himself comfy and treat them like family, but he can\u2019t wrap that concept around his head even though they\u2019ve been nothing but nice to him.

He was very committed and he did show affection physically and express his love for me... I just found it wasn't enough to outweigh all the other times he wouldn't listen to me and was disengaged. He had real difficulty listening and being engaged in conversations with me if it was about me. He blamed it on undiagnosed ADD, and based on what he said I think it might be. We talked about it a lot in the second and third year of our relationship, and it was something I hoped we could work on together. I found that there was a lack of follow through on his part with any plan we made together for how to work on it. We also had lots of positive things in our relationship\u2026 we share some similar interests and goals for the future. We get along well with each other\u2019s families and friends. We agree on where to live, finances, division of household labour, and most aspects of how we would want to raise our kids. \n\nAlso, during this time his dad died, so it was not a good time to be working on the relationship for him, while he was grieving. Fast forward 1.5 years...Things came to a head a few months before it ended when he told me he didn't think I would still want to be with him 5 years from now because I didn't like who he is as a person. I was really surprised, because I did talk about our issues relatively often, but also acknowledged the positive things about him and our relationship at least as often, but I would say more often. We had serious conversations after he brought this up, and each time I felt he pulled away and disengaged more and more. I was honest that the amount he was able to listen and engage with me was not enough. Another issue was him being very resistant to doing things with me that I wanted to do. He could be quite dismissive. Recently he started saying that he felt like he had to entertain a child, that my expectations are unrealistic (as an example, I suggested that we could talk for 5 minutes when I got home and then he could play video games the rest of the evening), and that I want a \"perfect\" relationship, so I'll never find anyone. I backed off for a while because he said it was impossible to do anything positive for the relationship while we were so focused on the problems/so close to breaking up (fair enough). \n\nI ended it after a month of me doing my own thing more and not mentioning the problems because I checked in with how he was feeling/what he was thinking about all those serious discussions we had and he told me he thought everything was resolved because I hadn't broken up with him. He told me he didn't get what my issue was with our relationship (we had been talking about it for ~2 years)... that he'd been this way his whole life (re: his distraction/poor listening) and didn't see it changing, and that if I wasn't happy with how things were I should leave and not waste more of our time. I ended it 5 days later. \n\nHe showed a lot of emotion when I agreed to see him a week after we broke up, and he said he had a lot of realizations- that he took me for granted and wants to work on the things I kept asking him to work on... but I don't know if it will ever be enough. He says he couldn't hear me before, but he hears me now, and that he lost sight of how happy it makes him to make me happy. He says he does want the kind of relationship I want, and if it's the biggest challenge in his life, he's willing to take it on because he's more sure about me than anything else in his life. I tried talking to him so many times BEFORE ending it, and would ask for input on what we could do to improve our communication and I'd suggest things he could do that would make it easier for me to accept his independence, etc... I'd ask him what I could do too.. but nothing ever stuck. Part of me wants to believe he can work on these things, but I wonder if I should even try at this point.

I've started apologizing to people for speaking too much, and everyone except for him tells me I have nothing to apologize for and that they're listening. I feel like I'm not good enough for him in his eyes because he's more prepared for his future with loads of internships and research positions and I'm not, because I'm struggling with some rough mental health issues and he's not.\n\nHe never tells me what he's feeling, even when I ask. He doesn't tell me what he's doing with his days, even when I ask. He doesn't ask me to hang out with me for weeks on end and never tells me he misses me.

I have finished *maybe* 10 times with him. I have told him *explicitly multiple times* that he needs to go down on me because I deserve to finish too, and he says he will change, and he just \"forgets\" or \"gets tired.\"  It makes me feel so awful about myself knowing that he doesn't prioritize my own pleasure.\n\nI'm going back to school this semester and he's not.

He doesn't do anything really aside from just tell me periodically that he loves me.\n\nWhen I addressed some of this, he got sincerely emotional for the first time in a while and said his actions are all filled with so much love (an acts-of-service love language type guy) and that we've talked about how he struggles showing emotions and struggles communicating. But still. Even after our talk. I haven't felt loved by him since around the time we first started dating.\n\nI just can't lose him. He is still my best friend.

I am the second oldest of six kids. We grew up very conservative and religious like low key cultish. We were home-schooled and really didn\u2019t interact with many people outside of our family. Long story short, my mom and dad got a divorce because my dad can be a super manipulative asshole. It was for the best. Now my sister, (i\u2019m just going to call her Jen) and I were VERY close growing up. I didn\u2019t have any real friends. People who were going through the same stuff as me. Jen honestly back then, was kinda my mom in a sense. Mom would be gone all the time and she always made sure we were fed and happy and safe. Until about two years ago she was the person I was closest to into the entire world. Now around the time when I was 14 I realized I was a lesbian. I remember telling Jen pretty early on and she didn't act like it was a big deal. We talked about it a few times but we never really had any issues. Jen is Religious, her husband is also religious, so i knew there was some form of \u201coh i don\u2019t really agree with this\u201d but I just always thought she still loved me, she still wanted to be with me when i get married. \n\nOkay so now onto the actual story, so currently Jen is Married in Florida very far away from all of us. I have been with my current partner for almost two years now, my family loves her, i love her and we\u2019ve been talking about marriage, just general stuff. Jen and I were facetiming and talking about stuff and I brought up the fact I was thinking about getting married. She gets very quiet. Jen and I had always promised to be each others bridesmaids. I brought up something along those lines about how I wanted her to be mine. Jen tells me that her and her husband have decided they are not coming to my wedding.\n\nI was really shocked and hurt. She told me how she couldn't come because it was supporting my marriage, and how it was a sin and God didn\u2019t want us to and all this crap that i was not ready to hear from the person whose opinion I valued the most. \n\nIt shattered me.\n\nThis was my best friend, my sister and she was flat out refusing to come to my wedding. \n\nI hung up pretty soon after that, telling her i understood because to a point i did but to another point i fucking furious because that Is my WIFE she is rejecting and it feels like Im being torn in two and i can\u2019t figure out what to say, or even what i want to say because shes so far away and i can\u2019t remember what she looks like sometimes. We have barely talked sense then, it's just not the same. covid is not making it better. I\u2019m really lucky, I have tons of supportive family now. It still fucking hurts so bad though. She wants things to go back to normal but I just can\u2019t.

My entire pregnancy has been him stressing on stuff like that and I honestly haven\u2019t been able to enjoy it because he stresses me out or he\u2019ll just sit alone constantly in his head worrying about what\u2019s wrong with him, when in reality nothing is wrong with him he just thinks there is or it seems like he wants something to be wrong with him. He\u2019s also scared to go to the DR because they will find something wrong with him so he refuses to go.

When we started dating we\u2019d have sex 2 or 3 times a week which I thought was pretty healthy and was super happy with and now it\u2019s twice a month if I\u2019m lucky. She also hasn\u2019t initiated any type of sexual activity with me in 1yr+. I have to try and initiate it each and every time. She will offer to give me head if I bug her about wanting to have sex enough, but this is usually like twice a month as well and never feels sexy, it always feels like a pity blowjob that she could not be less interested in. And yes, I\u2019ve tried initiating by seducing her, giving back rubs, neck kisses, all that stuff and I still get shot down a solid 90% of the time. I\u2019ve resorted to straight up asking her \u201chey can we have sex\u201d to which she will say no 9 times out of 10. \n\nAs some backstory, we started dating 1yr & 9 months ago and moved in together a little over 9 months ago. When we started dating (this part messes with me mentally the most) she had just come off of a \u201cFWB\u201d relationship with this guy from tinder. We were super open and comfortable talking about our pasts and such, so she told me that they met up usually every other day if not more for the sole purpose of having sex. She also told me she\u2019d go out with her friends every weekend for the sole purpose of finding guys to bring home and sleep with. Before all of that she was in a longer relationship (2+ years) that ended because of distance. From what she\u2019s told me, their sex life was overactive as well and she thinks they had sex at least once a day when they were together. I\u2019m not judging her for any of this, it\u2019s just frustrating knowing all of this then to hear \u201cI just don\u2019t like sex\u201d as a response when I bring it up. It makes me feel absolutely disgusting and unwanted and has really triggered the worst depression I\u2019ve had in a long time.\n\nI have tried to bring it up in the nicest ways a few times and every time I do she gets incredibly frustrated and the conversations usually end with her mad and ignoring me for trying to ask about it. Recently, after badgering her for a while she finally said she just doesn\u2019t like sex, it used to be \u201cI don\u2019t know why\u201d when I\u2019d ask why we don\u2019t do it more often. I tried asking her how she had a FWB for months if she didn\u2019t like having sex? She of course got super mad and refused to talk to me about it which is pretty common.\n\nI\u2019m really at the end of my rope and I don\u2019t know what to do. She says it has nothing to do with me but I don\u2019t know how I can believe that when she had such an \u201cactive\u201d past before she met me. I stay up at night usually a few hours longer than her, and for the past month I\u2019ve spent that time just thinking about what would happen if we broke up and how to do it and how it would play out and this and that. Right now I have a few hang ups on that subject:\n\n1.) I feel awful wanting to breakup with the girl I love because of this, and it seems like a super shallow/fixable thing. On the flip side it seems that it\u2019s impossible to fix with her or that she doesn\u2019t want to.\n2.) Money. I mentioned we live together and I would not be able to afford rent here or at any apartment in our city for that matter on my own. I don\u2019t have any family nearby or anything like that and I truly don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if we broke up. (When she moved in with me I had a roommate/old friend from HS that was planning on moving out to live with his gf as well- it was just perfect timing. Since then he and I have grown apart and haven\u2019t talked in 6+ months)\n3.) The thought of her with someone else. This one is the biggest for me. This really destroys me mentally. I\u2019m still very much in love with this girl, and just thinking about her moving on and being with someone else brings me to tears and sick to my stomach just thinking about it. What if it is me? What if we break up and it gives her the freedom to finally find the man of her dreams and they fuck like bunnies. The thought train usually gets to this point and then I get so depressed/mentally drained that I just physically cannot think about it any longer without vomiting and I go to bed thinking tomorrow will be better and everything will just magically be ok. It never is.\n\nWhat do I do. I\u2019m physically and mentally exhausted. This cannot be healthy for any part of me and it\u2019s really rotting me from the inside out. I\u2019ve never been in such a dark lonely place feeling so alone, but at the same time living with the girl I love and that I hoped to call my wife some day. I sometimes fantasize about other girls and think what life would be like if I was with someone who\u2019s sexual energy matched mine, and that honestly makes me sick to my stomach- what a vile thing to do, but I can\u2019t help it. Our lease here is up in October and I need to figure out what the hell to do before committing another 12 months of my life to this.

I've been leading him on and want to cut this off before it becomes a long distance relationship that will most likely fail.", "text": "I met a guy named William in February of this year and immediately had a little crush on him, but didn't think that it would lead to us becoming closer. In June, he told me he liked me and was willing to wait for me. I told him at that time that I didn't think a relationship between us would last, and that we should stay friends. However, since then I've been quite a bit of an asshole by going back and forth on whether to commit to a relationship with him. \n\nThere are a few signs that pushed me away from committing: we aren't good at talking to each other over the phone (texting or calling), it seems like we don't have much in common (but we do get along and he makes me happy when we hang out), and I've never been in a relationship before. I'm also leaving for college in almost a week, so this would be a long distance relationship if I don't speak up. He knew from the beginning that I will be leaving soon, but he's still adamant that a long distance relationship will work if I just trust in it. I doubt it will, though, because I don't feel as much of a connection with people when I only speak to them over the phone (not including family or very close friends). I think more logically when I'm not around him.\n\nSince June I've been a huge hypocrite, saying one thing but doing another. For example, I would text him that we should remain friends and yet let him be touchy with me (he likes to grab my hand and whatnot). I also don't tell him to stop when he compliments me or starts talking about how it's going to be boring without me when I leave (I find it awkward and tend to brush it off when someone compliments me). It's not an excuse, but I kept finding it hard to reject him in person and really felt like I could go through with the long distance relationship. A few days ago I told him that if we could improve our communication, then I was 100% down for the relationship. We spoke about him visiting me and vice versa so that we could still see each other face-to-face. At this point I knew we were heading into official relationship territory, but I genuinely thought then that it was going to work out.\n\nI guess our relationship its peak yesterday when I invited William to my home to hang out and watch a movie after we hung out for a few hours. William ended up staying the night and I let myself sleep next to him. It didn't go farther than cuddling and sleeping right next to each other. He asked me last night if we were a couple and I said yes (\"I guess, sure\") because we were so close physically at that point. I believe he also briefly kissed me on the lips, but I'm not sure if that was real or not because I didn't sleep very well - I may have imagined it. I guess we are a couple after last night. \n\nHowever I do very much regret letting him spend the night and letting myself sleep next to him. William and I hung out in the past and I kept leaving our time together with slight regret (regret about my hypocrisy and leading him on) that was soon forgotten (all my arguments for not committing seemed weak when I was with him), but I feel like this is a more final type of regret. I don't think I'm emotionally mature enough for a relationship, especially with somebody I don't know all that well like I do my closest friends. I don't have the good type of butterflies in my stomach and I don't feel flustered as much when I'm around him anymore. \n\nI know I'm an asshole and horrible for stringing him along like this, not sticking to my initial answer of \"let's just stay friends\" and generally not being straightforward. I've learned from that. Right now I'm looking for advice on how to tell him I can't continue this. Last night made me realize that at this point in my life I can't be in a relationship with somebody. I don't want to hurt him anymore and I especially don't want to leave the possibility of us open in the future. I'd like for him to move on and find someone else that's more sure about being with him. \n\nHow can I tell him that its not him, its me? How do you reject(?) somebody when you've lead them along like I have? Thanks for any advice.. and sorry that this is kind of all over the place. I'm not good at explaining things very well.\n\nTL;DR I don't know how to reject a guy (William) after leading him on since June (which is am 100% guilty of, and I regret not standing firm with my initial rejection of him). I'm assuming that we're an official couple after a cuddle session, and this will probably become a long distance relationship in the next week as I'm leaving for college. That cuddle session made me realize that I'm not emotionally mature for a relationship, but I haven't spoken with him about it yet. I'm hoping to find the least asshole-y way to end this with him.

Needless to say, we don't see each other a whole lot since we're so far away, but we go on vacation once or twice a year with our families. I've known her my whole life but I became friends with her a couple of years ago and we now text or talk every day. We have been in a mutual friend zone about as strongly as can be and although we are very good friends there has never been anything even close to going beyond that. Also, she is bi, and from what I can tell leans towards liking other girls more than guys.   \n\n\nWe were on a vacation in Montana, a pretty typical outdoorsy 5 day vacation for us. I'll call my friend E. The first three days were typical -- fun but not much to talk about. But for the last two nights we stayed in a hotel that gave us extra rooms because our reservation or something was messed up due to COVID. Anyways, I got my own room and E and her sister, L \\[14\\], got their own room. Since my room had two beds (well, sort of, a queen bed and a pullout couch that was basically a single bed), they wanted to have a sleepover type thing. This isn't unusual on its own, we're comfortable with each other and whatnot. \n\nThe first night we all played various games and watched some TV for probably about an hour before L fell asleep, and because E and I weren't tired we went to sit on the couch bed. We read through old text conversations (between ourselves) on my phone and at one point she put her elbow on my shoulder like you would put your elbow on the window of a car to rest. This was definitely pretty unusual, as we aren't touchy people and the only physical contact we'd ever had was fake hitting each other or wrestling for something, like a phone. Anyways, at one point we got to some photos that she sent in messages and she tried to take my phone so we wouldn't look at them, but I pulled it away and basically ended up lying down on the bed trying to keep it away. Usually at this point she would just give up or maybe reach around to grab it, but she just laid on top of me with one hand on it and eventually gave up, but didn't move, and rested her head on my shoulder/chest for what was probably half an hour before it was super late and we both decided we should try to get some sleep. We slept for maybe an hour (in separate beds) before someone made a loud noise in the hallway and we both woke up, although her sister somehow slept through it. E came back and sat above the pillows and played with my hair for a while, which was also unusual. Then she said she was tired and crawled down into the bed and just laid next to me for the better part of an hour. Keep in mind that this is an extremely small bed and there was nothing comfortable about this from a needing to sleep perspective. Then her sister started to shuffle around and E jumped up quickly, and at that point we were all up and went about our day. No mention of anything at all, except for one point in the morning where E made some awkward compliments about my hair and eyes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next night was the same situation, except L fell asleep much faster and E came over to my bed again, and this time put her head on my shoulder pretty much right away. We were both very tired since we barely slept the night before, and she laid down again next to me and said she was tired and asked me to put my phone away, which I did. We laid down for a while until she said she was going to go sleep. She also patted the top of my head when she said this which was an interesting gesture and I still don't exactly understand that. Anyways, she sat up and then gave up on standing up and laid back down, and about 10 minutes later she did the exact same thing and eventually got up and went to sleep. Notably, every time her sister kind of shuffled or the door creaked or something, E sat or stood up, so she clearly didn't want other people seeing what was going on... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been over 3 weeks since the trip, and while we've texted every day as usual since, there has been essentially no mention of these nights except for her saying that she misses the pullout couch bed because \"it was comfortable.\" I really cannot stress enough how nothing like this has ever happened between us before, how even a year ago her accidentally brushing my leg made her say \"ew.\" Also of note, I didn't really initiate any contact or anything. I went along with it because I didn't mind at all, but she did initiate basically everything. I really just don't know what to do now. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize a good friendship, but I am also curious about why she did what she did those two nights. \n\nTL;DR: Spent a couple of nights with close friend where she was unusually touchy and close, but there's been no mention about it since, idk why she did what she did or what I should do now."}, {"id": "ibtqcy", "n_comments": 6, "name": "My(19M) girlfriend(19F) doesn't believe in marriage", "text": "My girlfriend and I are very happy together.

Look Im not into the whole giant expensive wedding thing, neither is she for obvious reasons. I'd honestly be fine with getting married in the courthouse. Obviously it's her belief and I respect that but I wouldn't mind having something that represents us  as a couple. We haven't talked about it openly. I know we're only 19 and that's WAY down the line but it's something that I've been thinking about lately. I never considered myself the romantic type until I met her. I know she would agree to do it if I told her I wanted to some day, but I want her to marry me because she actually wants to get married. Maybe marriage isnt necessary, we can love each other and stay together without some piece of paper. Idk this is all over the place but I needed to get my thoughts down.\n\nTldr: my girlfriend doesn't believe in marriage and I want to marry her some day"}, {"id": "ibtq4b", "n_comments": 7, "name": "My childhood best friend (F28) uninvites me to wedding (F28)...

Striving for a world where women (or more generally, **everyone**) can roam freely at night is unrealistic.\n\nI regularly hear that women should not have to feel unsafe walking alone at night, as a result of the patriarchy and men preying on vulnerable women. Apparently it's a common assumption that men do not feel this pressure whatsoever, which is entirely bullshit. Everyone **should** feel this way when walking alone at night. Anything can happen to anyone.\n\nI'm a white male and have been assaulted walking home from work last year, when a group of drunk men asked me to have a drink with them, I declined and they yelled slurs at me and threw empty glass bottles at me. One of my male school friends, who is a bodybuilder, was stabbed walking late at night.\n\nWe *all* feel that way because we need to be psychologically and physiologically prepared to flee a threat. Sketchy, fucked up people will always exist, unfortunately. They prey on vulnerable targets, and night time is the peak for these twisted fucks as it is isolated and dark, and when most are drunk.\n\nIf we hypothetically reach a state where people can feel entirely safe walking alone at night, they are more vulnerable and unsuspecting to possible attacks. We need to be alert. It's our natural response to trying to stay the fuck alive.\n\nEdit: I probably used 'unsafe' and 'alert' interchangeably when they have different meanings. This is poor phrasing on my behalf, what I mean is that we should be alert. We shouldn't feel unsafe at all times, but rather we should recognise that the environment can be unsafe.

Unless you have a phobia of bats or something then you need to re-asses your reaction. By the time they stopped screaming a teacher had already got a net and was poking at the bat with it, trying to catch it. And they were still screaming. Anyone who genuinely screams at the top of their lungs at something that is under control is an attention seeker who probably has a shitty personality anyways."}, {"id": "ib5vg1", "n_comments": 272, "name": "the whole situation where a \u201cpopular\u201d student asks disabled or handicap student to a school dance should not be on the news.", "text": "Not sure if this is unpopular where you guys live, but from my viewpoint I see this a couple times a year on the news and people applaud it and it makes me so angry. \n\nThe whole \u201cstar football player student asks girl with Down\u2019s Syndrome to the homecoming dance.\u201d As if it\u2019s some massive achievement.

Workers who stock store shelves, drive trucks, deliver packages, work in warehouses, deal with rude costumers all day in restaurants and retail stores, the people who make it possible so you can take a shower every morning or deal with your human waste when you flush the toilet etc. Why do these people not deserve to be paid a wage that allows them to eat, pay their bills and save a little extra? Millions of Americans (and people all over the world really) are living paycheck to paycheck meanwhile greedy business owners are sitting on millions and billions without a care in the world.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying someone delivering groceries or working the cash register at your favorite restaurant deserves to be making 100k a year but at the same time shouldn't have to be begging for tips to barely pay their $1400/month rent on a minimum wage that hasn't been adjusted to meet the standards of inflation since 2009. Now for those who want a little extra to buy their Mercedes Benz then by all mean go to school and get into those fields with a lot higher paying salaries to meet the standard of the way you want to live.

Please read it all the way through before posting your question.\n\n**Important:  If your post was removed and you were directed here, and your specific question is not answered, it means there is no answer anyone here can provide for you at the moment, or your question is simply too location and/or fact specific for us to provide any useful information.  Please do not modmail us with \"but my question wasn't answered in the FAQ.\"  If it was removed, there is simply no other help we can provide you at this time.**\n\nThis is the best information we have at the moment and a number of different mods and contributors assisted with gathering information.  \n\nTo the best of our ability, we are updating it as new information becomes available.\n\nREAD THIS QUESTION AND THE ANSWER FIRST:\n\n* **Any question that ends with something to the effect of \"is this legal?\"  or \"this must be illegal, what can I do?\"**\n\nThe courts are now closed in many areas, so the answer is \"nothing right now.\"  Nobody is going to be hearing requests for immediate relief on most civil matters.\n\nIf you're receiving an ultimatum from your employer, *whether it's working at all, or not working from home, or working without proper gear, or working at risk of exposure*, you will have to make a decision whether to follow it or not.  If you don't comply with what the employer wants, yes, they can fire you.  We cannot tell you right now if it's possible you'll have a lawsuit or other remedy later on.  We don't know.  Nobody knows.  We are in an unprecedented situation, and it will not only depend on how the law develops but also very fact-specific inquires.\n\nWe can tell you this:\n\n~ If you are sick, stay home.  Stay home even if you are well except for essential activities.\n\n~ If you are fired or laid off, file for unemployment immediately, and online if at all possible.\n\n~ If you are non-exempt, you must be paid for all hours worked.  You can file for back pay with the proper agency once its open again.\n\n~ If your employer allows you to work from home, you cannot be required to use sick, vacation, or other PTO. \n\n~ Many states are pausing all evictions and foreclosures.  Check Google for state-specific information.\n\n* **What can you tell us about the recent federal legislation?**\n\n[Families First Coronavirus Response Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fl05bt/quick_bullet_points_on_families_first_coronavirus/?) (Sick/family leave)\n\n[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) (Cash payments, unemployment expansions, tenant relief, etc.)\n\n* **Where can I find information on COVID-19 related unemployment questions?**\n\nYou can find a link to the FAQs provided by all 50 states [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/g8la5x/links_to_state_unemployment_faqs_on_covid19/?).\n\n* **I was laid off or furloughed and I'm collecting unemployment.  If I refuse to return to work when called back by my employer, will I lose my unemployment benefits?**\n\nIt depends on your state's specific rules, but generally, the answer is yes.  Unemployment benefits are contingent on your being willing and able to work.  If you refuse work, you may lose your benefits.  \n\nIf you are asked to return but your reason for refusing to return is fear of COVID-19, you would most likely have to point so a specific practice or practices of your employer's to justify it.  Just a general fear is unlikely to be sufficient.\n\nThe requirement to accept work if offered is different from the requirement to actively look for new work, which has been temporarily suspended. \n\nIt's possible you might be eligible for some other kind of protected or paid leave after you return (you must go back to work to be eligible).  See our page on the [FFCRA](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fl05bt/quick_bullet_points_on_families_first_coronavirus/?) for information on family leave and paid sick leave.\n\n* **Can I be denied entry to a business or fired if I have a physical or mental condition that makes wearing a mask uncomfortable or impossible for me?**\n\nProbably. You can be denied accommodation under the ADA if you represent a direct threat to other users of a public accomodation under \u00a7 36.208(a) Direct threat.\n\n>(a) This part does not require a public accommodation to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that public accommodation when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.\n\nThe same doctrine would apply to employers, though it is codified separately under \u00a7 1630.2(r):\n\n>\"[a] significant risk of substantial harm to health or safety of self or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\"\n\nWhile no courts have yet ruled on this issue in the context of the present COVID pandemic, it is likely that failure to comply constitutes a prima facie direct threat for the purposes of both of these statutes.\n\n* **I'm furloughed but my employer expects us to work for free from home/at the workplace.**\n\nYour employer must pay you for all hours worked.  It is not legal at any time to expect you to work for free.  If your employer fires you for refusing to work for free, you can make a complaint to whatever entity handles wage and hour complaints in your state (which in some states is the federal Department of Labor).\n\n* **If I wasn't required to file a tax return for 2018 or 2019, can I still get a stimulus payment?**\n\nYes, if you otherwise qualify for a payment.  If you aren't required to file a tax return, you can [fill out this form on the IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here).  If you are required to file (for example, because your gross income exceeded $12,200 single/$24,400 married) you must file a return instead of using the form. \n\nPlease check [the page on the CARES Act] (https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) for other information on this legislation.\n\n* **Can I do this/that/whatever under my state's stay at home order?**\n\n[Here is a useful roundup and links to the orders in all 50 states.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/06/coronavirus-stay-at-home-by-state/)  (There is no paywall at the moment.)\n\nKeep in mind that just because you CAN do something that doesn't mean you should.  Stay home means stay home.  It's for everyone's safety, and the more that everyone complies, the sooner these orders can be lifted.  \n\n* **Can I be forced to use PTO before a furlough/layoff?  Must PTO be paid out prior to a PTO furlough/layoff?**\n\nWe do not know of any state that prohibits employers from requiring employees to use PTO or vacation time at the beginning of or prior to a furlough/layoff. In other words, if your boss tells you that you are being furloughed but first you are required to use up your PTO/vacation time, then you are probably stuck.\n\nHowever, if you are eligible to use leave provided by the Families First Act, your employer cannot require you to use other leave prior to using the FFA leave. Worth noting: If you are laid off, you are probably not eligible for FFA leave.\n\nThe trickier question is whether employers are required to pay out accrued PTO/vacation banks when furloughing/laying off employees. It is tricky because 1) some states require payout of PTO/vacation upon termination, and some don't; and 2) some states may distinguish between a layoff and a termination, and some don't. As an example, California requires payout of PTO/vacation time for layoffs longer than 10 days or without a fixed return date. Most other states are less generous toward employees.\n\n* **Is my employer/job considered \"essential?\"**\n\nExcept for the obvious, we don't know.  Check your particular state, city, or county's order (here is [the California order,](https://covid19.ca.gov/img/EssentialCriticalInfrastructureWorkers.pdf?te=1&nl=california-today&emc=edit_ca_20200323&campaign_id=49&instance_id=16995&segment_id=22614&user_id=d976d65d78d90cea1530af9fd4ae893f&regi_id=7886865120200323) for example).  Please see the previous answer for \"what if I'm not essential and my employer still wants me to work?\"\n\nIf you believe a business is staying open illegally, you can contact whomever the state, city, or county has designated for such reports.  In the absence of that information, contact whomever provides that business with a business license or other certification required to operate -- exactly who that is will depend on the type of business.\n\n* **Can my employer reduce my pay?**\n\nGenerally, yes.  For nonexempt (generally hourly) workers, it can be reduced to minimum wage in your state/locality.\n\nFor exempt (generally salaried) workers, it can be reduced as long as it doesn't go below the legal floor.  Under the FLSA, that's $35,568 per year.  But your state may have more stringent requirements as the minimum salary is tied to minimum wage, which varies by state.  So check the minimum salary for exempt workers in your state.  Here is [some information](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/employers-must-review-state-overtime-exemption-rules.aspx), but it does not cover every state.\n\n* **Is my employer legally required to tell us if a co-worker has had a positive COVID-19 test?**\n\nAs far as we can tell, there is no legal obligation for the employer to inform other employees of a positive COVID-19 test or diagnosis.  Best practice seems to be to inform but not identify, but this is not a legal obligation.  At this point, we should all be behaving as if every person we come into contact with is infected.\n\n* **I'm still working.  Can my employer take or require me to take my temperature before starting my shift?**\n\nYes, via infrared, oral, ear, or other non-invasive means, and they aren't required to have a doctor or nurse do this. \n\n* **I'm a health care worker and I was fired for speaking out about the lack of PPE at my facility.**\n\nStart [here](https://www.osha.gov/whistleblower/WBComplaint.html).\n\n* **I have something due/a date at a court/with the DMV/some other agency?**\n\nCheck the relevant web site.  They are probably granting extensions.\n\n* **I have a custody/visitation problem.**\n\nMany jurisdictions are issuing specific blanket orders that parents are to adhere to the existing schedule whether or not school is in session; some jurisdictions have issued other blanket orders as well.  You should check the website of the family court where your order was issued before doing anything else.  For child support/garnishment issues, check the web site of the entity that handles those issues in your state.\n\nWith respect to other issues, ordinarily, we would tell you that in the absence of a modification or emergency order, you obey the order in hand unless the child is in imminent danger.\n\nRight now there may be no way to modify an order or to seek an emergency order.  Our best advice is that parents should act like adults in the time of a national emergency, and work it out, keeping in mind that this is not about winning or losing a battle with the other person, but what is best for your child.\n\nDo NOT call 911 for custody disputes unless a crime has been committed or someone is in imminent physical danger.  These are not police emergencies.\n\nIf you cannot work it out and you are the one facing disobeying a court order, you need to have a very, very good explanation for it.  \"I don't feel safe with my child with the other parent\" is not a good explanation.  \"We were under a mandatory shelter in place order and couldn't drive 30 miles to the custody handoff\" might be.\n\nThe available evidence is that COVID-19 is not particularly dangerous to young children *who aren't immunocompromised* or otherwise particularly vulnerable. Most likely judges will not look kindly on people who violate custody orders because they disagree with their co-parent about degrees of COVID-19 protection *when the dispute relates solely to the health of the otherwise healthy children.*\n\nIn general, if whatever dispute you have eventually ends up in court, whichever party acted unreasonably can expect no mercy from the judge.\n\n* **Is x a COVID-19 related scam?**\n\nNumerous scams are popping up.  Use appropriate caution.  [FTC page](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/coronavirus-scams-what-ftc-doing).\n\n* **Are curfew/stay home/shelter in place orders by the mayor/governor legal?**\n\nThe Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 264, gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to take measures to limit and prevent the spread of infectious disease. While laws vary state to state in language and scope, every state has an analogous law that allows authorities to impose quarantine and other restrictive measures; this power does not include tribal lands.\n\n* **Some business/person is not obeying a shelter in place/stay home order.  What can I do?**\n\nThis is very location-specific.  You can try 311 in your city/county, or Google to see if your jurisdiction has designated a specific office to take such reports (the City of Los Angeles, for example, requests reports [on this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCy18l51yeciH_bL2InvGfc1Xo6IVHXTDYGFvpx8GnLzxCIA/viewform)).  Do NOT call 911 as this is not a police emergency.\n\n* **The CDC/Governor/Some other official recommended that people over 65 self-isolate.  I'm over 65.  Can I be fired if I don't go to work?**\n\nAs a practical matter... yes.  Your employer can fire you.  Might you have a cause of action for wrongful termination later on?  We don't know.  See the first question in this FAQ.\n\nIf you are fired, you should file immediately for unemployment.\n\n* **My employer closed the business entirely and ordinarily would have been required to give notice under the WARN Act (or a similar state law).  Was notice required here?**\n\nThe federal WARN Act has an exception for \"unforeseeable business circumstances,\" and it's hard to see how this wouldn't qualify.  An important indicator that a business circumstance is not foreseeable is that it is caused by a \"sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition outside the employer\u2019s control.\"\n\nYou'll have to check your state's specific law, but many either have similar exceptions or others that would apply here, such as \"calamity\" (California).\n\n* **My workplace is shut down due to COVID-19, and/or I was fired or laid off due to COVID-19.  What do I do?**\n\nFile for unemployment benefits *immediately* if you are eligible or believe you might be.  See our [CARES Act page](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) for more information.\n\nIf you will have trouble paying rent, speak to your landlord; some eviction protections are in place through the [CARES Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) and others through state or local action.\n\nIf you will have trouble with mortgage or other payments, check your lenders' web site for further information.  \n\n* **I'm sick, under doctor-ordered quarantine, I have to care for someone who is sick, or care for a child who's out of school.  I don't have any paid sick leave or FMLA protection. What should I do?**\n\n[If you are sick, stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html). \n\nSee our summary of the [Families First Coronavirus Response Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fl05bt/quick_bullet_points_on_families_first_coronavirus/?) and its sick leave provisions and the [CARES Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) and its unemployment provisions.\n\n* **Am I eligible for worker's comp if I was exposed at work?**\n\nMaybe, but unless you are a first responder or health care worker, it could be quite difficult to prove your exposure was at work.  You can always file a claim if you believe you were exposed at work.\n\n* **My company isn't shutting down.  If I get sick at work or on public transportation, can I sue the company for damages?**\n\nNo.  Ultimately it's up to you to weigh the risks and decide to go to work, or not to go.\n\nYou *may* be eligible for worker's compensation if you can establish you were exposed at work.  Unless you are a health care worker or first responder, this may not be easy, especially as the virus continues to spread in the community.  You can always file a claim if you believe you were exposed at work.\n\n* **I was traveling/exposed to someone with the virus etc.  Can my employer force me to stay home for two weeks?  Do they have to pay me?**\n\nYes, your employer can require you to stay away from work.  \n\nSee the links about leave policies under \"I don't have any paid sick leave or FMLA protection,\" as the same policies/benefits may apply.\n\n* **Can my employer forbid me to travel internationally/at all?**\n\nThey can't stop you, but in nearly all cases, they can fire you for breaking such a policy.\n\n* **Can assisted living facilities/nursing homes/hospitals restrict or ban visits?**\n\nYes.  This is to protect the lives of their vulnerable patients.  Use the telephone to speak to your family member.\n\n* **I have a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac backed mortgage.  Where can I find out more information about my options?**\n\n[Fannie Mae](https://www.fanniemae.com/portal/media/corporate-news/2020/covid-19-mortgage-options-7010.html)\n\n[Freddie Mac](https://freddiemac.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/freddie-mac-lump-sum-repayment-not-required-forbearance?_ga=2.148829236.2058328052.1588534305-1093381287.1584923058)\n\n* **I live in an apartment complex/building.  Can my landlord prohibit all guests during a stay-at-home order?**\n\nGenerally speaking, a landlord cannot restrict your right to have guests completely (they can restrict how many guests at one time and how long they can stay, but these restrictions are usually spelled out in the lease).  This is part of the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment (full, uninterrupted possession) of the leased property.\n\nRestricting all guests is probably not legal and if the landlord later tried to evict you for it, would be unlikely to be successful.  Conversely, it's unlikely to be a sufficient violation of the lease that would allow you to terminate your lease early.\n\nAnd that said, you really shouldn't be having guests -- \"stay at home\" applies to your guests, too.  Obviously, medically necessary visits and deliveries of packages and goods are not \"guests\" and should always be allowed.  If your landlord took active steps to limit these, you should call 311 or the relevant help line in your area and seek advice.  Unless a crime has been committed or someone is in immediate physical danger, do not call 911 as this is not a police emergency.\n\n* **My apartment building/complex sent out a notice requiring tenants to inform them if someone in my unit is diagnosed with COVID-19.  Is this legal?**\n\nWe don't have an absolutely clear answer.  But they certainly have a reasonable interest in knowing if someone is sick so they can take steps like cleaning common areas where that person might have been recently -- laundry rooms, elevators, mailrooms, etc.\n\nGiven the situation, and if the building/complex doesn't intend on releasing identifying information publicly, this seems to be a reasonable modification to their rules and regulations, which they have the legal right to change with notice. If you refuse to comply and they later find out you were sick, you can expect to be asked to leave at the end of your lease, or within the legal time if you are month to month.\n\n* **Someone in my apartment complex has/might have COVID-19.  Can I get out of my lease?**\n\nNo.\n\n* **My landlord wants to show my unit to potential renters/buyers. Can I refuse to let them in?**\n\nRelocation is considered essential, so concerns over contact with strangers is not a valid reason to refuse showings. People still need to move, and still need to find places to move into. That said, not all circumstances are going to be the same. Tenant\u2019s rights to refuse showings are state-specific and fact-specific to where it must be reasonably limited in scope and frequency, and there are statutory requirements for notice in almost all jurisdictions. Bear in mind that the people who are viewing the unit probably don\u2019t want to come be around stranger\u2019s homes any more than you want strangers to be in your home, and few people are seeking housing who don\u2019t absolutely have to be doing so at this time. \n\n* **I\u2019ve lost my job, or other COVID-related hardship requires me to need to break my lease. Can I do so without having to pay the liquidated damages (break fee) or rent going forward?**\n\nUnfortunately, no. While evictions are halted, and at a later point there will be better-defined conditions by which tenants will be able to enter repayment plans, there is no statutory option that gives tenants the right to break their lease through hardship in a state of emergency or other executive action such as this. Tenants who have lost their jobs or otherwise are in situations that they will be unable to remain in their home because of the pandemic will need to either pay their break fee or negotiate with their landlord to reach an agreement that lets them out of their future obligation.\n\n* **My roommate/tenant/subtenant invites people over despite a shelter order. Can I throw the guest out?**\n\nNo. Roommates have no superior right over the other to limit one's rights to have guests, even if the guest coming over is breaking the law by ignoring executive order. This is just a matter of not having standing, rather than it not being ethically or morally right.  Landlords also do not have the right to eject guests of their tenants - again, even in this circumstance. \n\n* **My landlord is not providing maintenance during this period. What can I do?**\n\nLandlords are obligated still to address habitability issues, such as heat/water/power. Landlords are not going to be penalized for not addressing things like a dripping sink or broken bathroom door handle in an immediate fashion. The standard for maintenance is \"reasonable timeframe,\" and the courts will simply extend the period of time in which a reasonable person might expect repairs to be done.\n\nThe rub is many housing courts are closed entirely. This means in cases where landlords are not addressing issues of habitability, tenants have nowhere to take them to obtain injunctive relief. (This means to get a court to order the landlord to fix/do something.) Unfortunately, this is a serious problem without a real solution; the only option a tenant has in this situation will be to vacate the unit and pursue the landlord for the expense incurred. You really, really, need to make sure you speak with a housing/tenant attorney before using this option, as it will be completely fact-specific. \n\n* **I am a landlord with a month-to-month (or other at-will term) tenant. Can I give them notice to vacate?**\n\nYes, with caveats. First, see above if your property applies in limits on your ability to evict. Please remember that \"eviction\" and \"terminate tenancy\" do NOT mean the same thing; eviction is the court proceeding to reclaim possession from a tenant in breach or overstay. You can still evict for overstaying valid notice to vacate as long as your housing courts are still open and as long as your state or municipality has not placed further limits on this. \n\n* **I own a small business.  Is there any help for me if its being devastated by COVID-19?**\n\nThe [Small Business Administration might be able to provide a loan](https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela) under emergency legislation.  Additionally, the CARES Act, which provides additional assistance for small business owners and non-profits, includes the opportunity to get up to a $10,000 Advance on an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). This Advance may be available even if your EIDL application was declined or is still pending, and may be forgiven if you meet specified criteria.\n\n* **Can my university/college require me to have my camera on during class and/or an online exam?**\n\nYes, there is no law preventing this, and it's obviously for the reasonable purpose of class participation and/or making sure you aren't cheating during closed-book exams.  If you object, take it up with the chain of command at your institution.\n\n* **Can my university/college force me out of the dorm?  Do they have to refund me housing fees already paid?**\n\nThe answer to the first question is yes; legally, they can close dorms.  It's unclear at this point if they have to refund or credit any fees already paid, although we suspect many will on a prorated basis.\n\n* **Does my university/college closing/switching to online classes get me out of my off-campus apartment lease?** \n\nProbably not, unless there's some special college-town provision in your lease about school closures... which is unlikely.  You can always terminate a lease early, but you're responsible for the landlord's damages.  And the landlord is held to normal provisions of landlord/tenant law, such as attempting to mitigate their damages by re-renting.  But keep in mind that may be particularly difficult given the situation.\n\n* **My university/college is still open and having classes on campus.  Can we make them close?**\n\nNo.  You can protest it as a policy decision as you would any other decision, but it's their decision to make.\n\nIf you have a disability recognized under the ADA or comparable state law that makes you particularly vulnerable, you should work with your school's disability services to request an accommodation.  The sooner the better.\n\n* **My university/college is closing campus and moving classes online.  Am I entitled to some kind of tuition refund?**\n\nLegally, as long as they are providing instruction and the ability to earn units, probably not, particularly given the situation.  You are free to try to negotiate something with them.\n\n* **My high school/university trip/travel abroad program is canceled/I have to come home.  Am I entitled to a refund?**\n\nIt really depends on the school's specific policies, any insurance you may have purchased, and other individual factors.  Mostly it's unclear how schools/universities are going to handle these matters for now.  Ask your institution what their policy is, investigate insurance coverage, but otherwise, sit tight for now and see how things develop.  Time to file a lawsuit (with the possible exception of government claims) runs in years, not days.\n\n* **My kid's public school is open.  Are they required to attend?**\n\nUnless the district has adopted a policy stating they won't treat absences as unexcused, then yes, your kid has to go to school, or they risk unexcused absences.\n\nIf your child or an adult in your household has a disability recognized under the ADA or comparable state law that makes that person particularly vulnerable, you should contact your school and/or district to request an accommodation.  The sooner the better.\n\n* **My kid's day care is closing, but they want us to keep paying.  What should I do?**\n\nThere's no crystal clear legal answer here.  Check your contract.  They probably want you to keep paying so they don't have to layoff their staff.\n\n* **What if I'm organizing an event, like a wedding or other party or conference, and have to cancel?   Am I entitled to refunds for deposits paid to the venue or vendors?  What if I can't perform a contract I entered into for some other purpose?**\n\nMany if not most commercial contracts -- such as rental of a wedding venue or delivery of a product -- suspend obligations that cannot be met due to an \"act of God.\" While courts have yet to rule that COVID-19 is an act of God within the meaning of those contracts, there is at least a reasonably high likelihood that they will do so. This will mean that the non-performing party to the contract is not going to be penalized for their failure to provide their good or service.\n\nAdditionally, such clauses [generally release both parties from performance under the terms of the contract](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/force_majeure) in which case you might be entitled to a refund. \n\nThe doctrine of \"impossibility\" *may* also create a legal excuse from performance under *certain conditions*, for example: 1) orders with the force of law prohibiting gatherings and closing venues where such gatherings occur; 2) level 4 travel warnings which result in the cancellation of all commercial flights to a location.\n\nEach contract is different, and it may prove difficult to obtain a refund for a number of reasons. Until courts reopen, however, like all other civil issues you are unlikely to have any way to reach a legal resolution.\n\nIf the amount of money at issue is significant, you can have a lawyer review your contracts for you once that's possible.  The best practical advice in the meantime is to try to work something out with the venue/vendors for a postponement.  \n\nIf you have insurance for your event, you may have a claim, depending on the coverage provisions.\n\n* **I paid for tickets to a canceled event.  Am I entitled to a refund?**\n\nUnclear at this time; it may depend on the terms and conditions of the tickets or ticketing agent, as well as other things.  Inquire from the vendor, see what they're offering, then sit tight for now and see how things develop.  Time to file a lawsuit runs in years, not days.

Do I have a valid insurance claim?**\n\nIt's going to depend on the language of your policy.  If you had  \"cancel for any reason\" (CFAR) coverage, you may be covered.  If you didn't and did not cancel because you (or in some cases a family member) was ill, you probably do not, but check your individual policy and with the carrier.  Some trip insurers, such as [Allianz](https://www.allianztravelinsurance.com/coverage-alerts/2019-novel-coronavirus.htm), are temporarily broadening their coverage.  Be sure to check with your carrier.\n\n* **I have to make travel plans for later this year.  What should I do?**\n\nParticularly if you are traveling internationally, consider travel insurance that includes a \"cancel for any reason\" (CFAR) provision.  Make sure that disease, epidemics, and pandemics are not excluded.  Cancel for any reason coverage generally has to be purchased very quickly after your reservations are made.  Check the deductible and make sure the amount covered is sufficient for your needs.\n\nTravel insurance is always a good consideration for international travel.\n\n* **Miscellaneous information**\n\nThe income tax filing deadline has been moved to July 15.\n\nThe October deadline to start using a RealID compliant document to access the secure areas of airports and other federal facilities has been postponed; no new deadline has been announced at this time."}, {"id": "ibhro0", "n_comments": 83, "name": "My landlord won\u2019t let us control how often the sprinklers run, but still makes us pay for the water bill.

[That's allowed for in the lease](https://i.imgur.com/Tdizx0J.png), and I understand why it's needed.\n\nAll three of my roommates moved out this year, and one of the empty rooms was getting an early transfer, so there were a lot of people coming in and out - they had to make sure that the transfer room was painted and cleaned first, then they had to clean and paint the other rooms, then they had to steam the carpets, etc. \n\n[The lease mentions proper notice for all of this](https://i.imgur.com/klT1hy9.png), and the only notice that I was given was a hand-written addition of the dates 8/2, 8/3, 8/12, and 8/13 on a printed flyer that described the cleaning/Turn process. It gave a picture example of 'dirty' (the kitchen counter being completely lost underneath a pile of junk) and 'clean' (the kitchen counter being, well, empty). It said that if my apartment is not 'clean', then I would be charged $550 to have a cleaning crew come in and do it for me. \n\nSo I took everything off the counters, wiped things down, etc. However, this is still an actively lived in space, and I figured it wouldn't be an issue to have just a single towel, hotpad, and fly trap out on the counter. \n\nOn 8/15, the property manager came in more or less unannounced to conduct a 'visual inspection'. I didn't get the time between her knocking and her entering to even get to the door, and she looked around for just a minute before briskly telling me that 'everything' needed to be cleaned. In the same sentence she said that those three objects needed to be taken off the counter, so I kind of balked at the pettiness, took those things off the counter, and then put them right back on after she left, thinking that was all she meant. She also left a pack of sanitizer wipes and another flyer saying to 'please use this to wipe down the counter in preparation for your new roommates'. Since I had already wiped down the counter myself, I figured that wasn't necessary, and just left them there. \n\nBut at some point, someone came in and added a hand-written addition to that note, saying 'On 8/15 we talked to Room B about cleaning the apartment and it was not cleaned, so we are hiring a cleaning service to come in and clean it. You will be charged.' As soon as I saw that yesterday I immediately went down to the office and had a less than productive conversation with the manager - I was, well, enraged at the idea of paying $550 to clean an apartment that I already viewed as clean, and she was adamant that it wasn't clean and that she had told me that. She said that she wasn't going to \"sit here and argue with [me], I can\u2019t have parents getting mad at me because their common area isn\u2019t cleaned\" and if I could clean it I wouldn't be charged and she would check tomorrow. So I tore up the flyer, left, and promptly cleaned the apartment to the best of my ability and means. I used the sanitizer wipes on the counter, swept the floor, took out the trash, wiped down the sink, etc. \n\nAround 8:30AM today I woke up just before I heard someone knocking and then entering my apartment, and before I knew it there was a cleaning crew inside aggressively cleaning every surface - moving furniture, mopping the floors, standing on chairs to clean hanging lamps, etc. I wasn't even sure if they were a cleaning crew before I saw their matching shirts. I left them alone, anxious about if I was going to charged, and then went out to check their work when they left. A maintenance crew from the apartment happened to enter as I was doing that, and I asked them if I would be charged.\n\n\"Yes, you will be, the apartment wasn't clean.\"  \n\"Uh, yes it was.\"  \n\"No it wasn't, sorry, you need to talk to the office about that.\"  \n\nAnd then they left.\n\nNow, the only thing the lease mentions about any kind of cleaning fee is a ['reasonable cleaning fee'](https://i.imgur.com/BQPB8Dg.png).

He informed me Friday afternoon that the manager had called and threatened to garnish my wages 25% if a pretty sizable payment was not received today.  \n\n\nI sent a letter to the corporate office detailing the above and threatening to retain a lawyer should they garnish my wages because not only did the manager knowingly allow a check to be fraudulently cashed in my name, he has also discussed my account and personal information with my roommate, which I did not give him permission to do. Furthermore, when my roommate called today to arrange the payment, the manager asked him to come in in person so he could show him the letter I sent because he didn't want to discuss it on the recorded lines. I asked my roommate to record their conversation and get a picture of the letter if possible because once again, he is discussing details that should be private.\n\nWhat action should I take? I can't afford a lawyer, and it probably wouldn't be worth it because the loan is not a huge amount, but I can't and shouldn't have this hanging over my head for the next couple of years while it's being paid off. I understand the check was cashed and the money is gone, but I did not receive a penny of it, and I tried to prevent this from happening. I also understand my roommate committed a crime, but I would prefer not to file criminal charges. He has come a long way, and I don't believe that he deserves a felony conviction and jail time over his first mistake after almost three years clean.\n\nIdeally, the loan could just be transferred into his name, whether he is eligible or not. If not, then I would be willing to pay the amount of the loan back without the interest and processing fees tacked on at lower monthly payment than what was offered. This would be the more affordable option for my roommate because I still have no intentions of paying for the loan myself. I have tried to make sure I have not said or done anything to indicate that I am accepting responsibility for the debt. Frankly, I think the manager should be terminated and the loan forgiven because of their sketchy practices. These types of companies prey on desperate people, and the manager's behavior has been unprofessional and borderline harassment."}, {"id": "ibsicq", "n_comments": 4, "name": "How do I make sure my spouse can't keep me from taking our kids back after a visit?", "text": "We aren't legally separated, there is no legal order of custody.

What should I do?", "text": "This happened yesterday at 11 AM. The flight UA79 heading to Narita Tokyo, ETA 1:55 PM was delayed for 1h 45 min due to a crew member being late. This might not sound like a big deal, but 120 of us temporary residents of the US was denied boarding. \n\nMost of us here are heading to Narita because we needed to board the connecting flight MF 810 at Narita heading to Fuzhou, China. The scheduled departure time for MF 801 was 3:30 PM and with UA79 delayed for almost 2 hours we would have arrived at Narita only to see our second flight flying away. Now as per Japan's travel regulation, while connection flights are allowed, entry (leaving airport) for foreign nationals (with or without visa) and overnight connection are both not allowed. And as per Narita airport's instruction to United (quoted from one of the UA representative at Newark liberty), we were not allowed to board UA79 because, again as per their explanation, there is no guarantee for us to procure alternative flights that leaves before midnight. \n\nAnd they would be right. China is already imposing on us--rightful Chinese citizens, which is beside the point--extremely strict travel restrictions, leaving only 1 round trip flight to China per airline per country per week. Take Japan to China as an example, All Nippon Airways would only be able to run a single flight per week to China and one flying back, with no guarantee on which city we actually land at. This restriction was since loosened to about two flights per week, and adding up all the currently operating airlines we get roughly 14 flights per week between Japan and China. Compare to before Corona hits where each airline would have multiple flights running per day for the entire week (perhaps not accurate here, but you get the gist) the current carrying capacity is far from enough to accommodate all of us, wanting to go home in this trying time. Almost everyone stranded here right now brought our tickets 3, or even 4 month ago, simply because none are available for closer dates. What's worst is the existence of grey market (for lack of a better term) ticket dealers that locks in these seats (how do they do it I do not know) and inflate the price for the tickets to upward 2000 USD. These we simply cannot afford. We made so much effort to get our tickets, only to have UA completely fuck us over. Only a handful of us will be able to hook up to alternative flights back home, simply due to how scarce tickets are.\n\nI personally am a 2020 college graduate with a visa that will last me long enough. But I now have nowhere to live since I travelled here from Boston. Many are on the same boat and already ended our tenancy. There are also people with visas that are expiring very soon, which will soon cause them to overstay, hindering there ability to enter the US in the future. Families (including elderly) have no place to stay, people been handed costs that they simply cannot afford.\n\nWhat did UA did to compensate us? Nothing really. You want to cancel/reschedule your flight? Go call our customer service. No accommodation for us whatsoever apart from a hotel vouchers for 1 night. Still charges us cancellation fees, mind you.  Absolute refusal for further communication with the higher-ups/connecting airline/Narita airport. Staffs are just trying to chase us away at this point.\n\nShamefully I do not know what are within my rights in this incident. I wish I had a lawyer to consult with but I don't.

The ad stated that the purchase price included delivery, and it also listed every dimension and all applicable details of the exterior and interior. \n\nWe had called around before even listing it to figure out the cost. We were quoted $300 plus $3/mile, this info was relayed to her the day she came to look at the shed. She lived nearby, so the delivery mileage would only be about 10 miles. After they paid, they were deciding on which property they wanted it on, they own 2 properties. She wanted to use the shed as either an office, or a spare room when her kids are home from college. In fact, on the memo line of the check it says \"office structure-mobile\".\n\nOn July 13th, I texted her to ask what address she'd like the shed delivered to, and also in which direction should it be placed onto the trailer to ensure it was facing the direction she wanted it on her property. She responded that she was still trying/in discussion with her town on the permitting for the shed. I told her that's fine, and that I just didn't want her waiting on me. \n\nDays go by, I hear nothing. I contact her again, via text, on July 20th. I ask her if she has updates, and she responded to tell me she'd check on it. Meanwhile, I cannot call and schedule a delivery without a destination address, and without knowing the orientation of the shed on the trailer. \n\nAnother 4-5 days go by, and this time my husband gives her a call on July 24th.

On Friday, we text her asking for the address and we finally get a destination address. \n\nThat Monday (8/3), we start calling around trying to get a hauling company out here to get this shed. Husband was having trouble getting anyone to call back, so Monday and Tuesday we made no progress. On Wednesday, we hear back from a couple of these companies. Turns out, our shed (when trailered) would exceed the regular load height for Ohio. We'd need a permit from the state, and the regular hauling companies wouldn't do the tow. The height wasn't discussed on the original calls to get quotes. We then called around to some trucking companies and the quotes were astronomical. Ok--no problem. We promised we'd handle delivery, so let's get to problem solving. Husband is handy as hell so he decides he's going to build a trailer big enough to haul the shed (it's 20' long), and just resell the trailer at some point because we could definitely make a profit. This seemed like a better option than paying $$$$$ for a trucking company to haul this shed. \n\nOn Friday (8/7), we text the buyer and let her know we'd been having trouble getting the tow scheduled and we'd get back to her. \n\nHusband spends all last week building this trailer, I'm handling getting the proper insurance and filing for this permit ($65). \n\nFriday rolls around (8/14), we text the buyer and let her know that we'd built our own trailer to haul it, and it turned out we'd need a permit so all we need to do was get that, and we'd be ready to deliver. \n\nShe calls that evening and asks for a refund because she doesn't want to go through \"such an ordeal\" when it's time for her to resell the shed.

My girlfriend (Moon) and I share a bedroom and our other two roommates share the other bedroom (Canine and Purple).  Moon and I don't actually know our other two roommates that well, but we made it work.\n\nMoon and I have been living in this apartment since early 2019 and have had a cycle of roommates since (2 were short-term living situations, 2 moved out to live with their girlfriends, and now the most recent two).  Canine moved in around October of 2019 and Purple moved in May 1st 2020.  Since the names had been changed on the lease a couple of times, we were told by our landlords that we could no longer change the names on the lease again.  None of us knew this when Purple moved in, but as soon as we did we told her as much.  She was pissed, but lived with us up until now and continues to reside here.\n\nWe usually pay our rent on the apartment's website, but since Purple was not on the lease, she paid Moon through Paypal and Moon paid double the rent through the website.  We thought everyone was satisfied with this, but Purple had been apparently quietly abusing Canine for weeks and it all came to a head this past Wednesday when she cut the power cord to the router Moon bought when we first moved in.  I confronted her (and Moon and Canine joined in) and she denied it but she was the only one not effected as she coincidentally always uses her wifi hotspot.  \n\nShe is extremely unstable and dangerous to live with to the point where Canine moved into my and Moon's bedroom and Moon and I got a storage unit to put all of the stuff that was in the living room into a safe place.  On top of that, Canine, Moon, and I are taking shifts to stay in our bedroom to babysit our stuff in case she tries to break in, which has led to missed shifts at our jobs.\n\nAnyway, all this to say Canine, Moon, and I filed a lease break form with our apartment and are leaving by September.  Purple has since continued to terrorize us, including filing a fraudulent claim with Paypal saying that the transactions for rent were done without her consent.  Moon has already contacted Paypal saying Purple is lying and that \"services were already fulfilled.\"\n\nI guess my question is does she have the legal right to try and take back the rent money she gave us since May?  Can she sue us for the rent money since she isn't on the lease?  If Paypal sides with her can we sue her for the money back since she was living here all this time?  It is a lot of money and breaking the lease also cost us a lot so if we do involve the court can we add on the lease break fee, what we would have earned at the missed shifts at work while we babysat our stuff from her terror, the cost of storage unit, and/or the damaged property?\n\nI know the answer is probably \"no\" to some of these, but I want to make sure we have our bases covered and can get most of our money back if it comes down to it.\n\nTL;DR  My roommate who has been living with us since May is now trying to file fraudulent claims on Paypal to get her rent money back since she isn't on the lease despite living here the whole time.

He later cut contact with me, sold the business, never told me, and now I've tracked him down. Any chance of recouping?", "text": "[CALIFORNIA]\n\nWill try to keep this concise but informative. Definitely some drama in here and stupid moves on my part. Guessing I'm SOL but given I just recently found this guy again my curiosity is piqued.\n\n* In 2014 a guy I know, Mark, owned a small business that relied on a manufacturer to produce orders of physical goods his business was selling.\n* A couple large orders were completed by the manufacturer but they were refusing to deliver them to the customer because Mark had not paid the manufacturer.\n* Mark asked me to help pay the manufacturer for these orders so they could get shipped to the customers and he could receive payment from the customers. No paperwork was drawn up for this.\n* I called up the manufacturer and paid for the orders over the phone with my credit card. The total amount was around $11,000.\n* Manufacturer shipped the orders to Mark's customers.\n* What Mark failed to share with me -- or lied to me, rather -- was that these orders were so long overdue to the customer that he wasn't charging for them. So the money I was expecting to be paid to Mark to in turn repay me was not coming in.\n* Fighting tooth and nail with him, Mark eventually starting paying me back $100 or $300 here and there, paying me back about $1500 of the $11,000.\n* Lo and behold, around that time he was arrested for something non-business related, convicted, and sentenced to a couple years in jail. I only found about this through news articles I found online after he stopped responding to me. At this point I figured my chances of recouping any more money were shot.\n* Fast-forward to last week. Under a name change, I found the dipshit on LinkedIn. He saw that I viewed his profile and surprisingly sent me a connection request. Of course this raised a lot of alarms for me in that I have zero intention of befriending him or giving him a penny more. But I figured just maybe I could get some money back.\n* When I brought up the debt, he said \"That's an old debt and I sold the company in 2014 before going to prison. Not much I can do about that now. But I'm willing to talk to you about it.\"\n* More so, he stated \"I sold the company along with the debt years ago. It's not my company nor my debt anymore.\" To which I responded \"That debt was not on the company books, we both know that. It was personal.\"\n* He went on, \"In fact legally I'm not even supposed to talk about my business after the acquisition nor his debts due to the contract that I signed.\"\n* To which I responded \"Either you A) disclosed that debt at the time of the sale and it was officially on the books, or B) didn't honestly disclose it because it was never on the books and hence pocketed the money from the sale that should have gone towards repaying that debt. Which is it? If the former, why was I not contacted and informed of the ownership change?\"\n* He concluded with \"This is a conversation that will have to involve other people and we will have to arrange a time for this. I will reach out to the company that took possession of my company in 2014 and see if they're interested in having a conversation. If not then there is no conversation because my company was rescued when I got locked up and not acquired and in that process I signed a contract for all liability and all debt and all trademarks. A good time to talk about this would have been in 2014 when you knew I was locked up and you could've talked to the new owner back then but I think now it's been too long and they've completely moved on and I don't even talk to them.\"\n\nI'm not sure how I was supposed to be aware he even sold the company when he stopped responding to me because he was in prison. How would I have known he sold, who the new owner was, and how to contact him?\n\nMark said to call him after he's off work tonight, but I don't intend to do so. Any communication we continue to have I want to be in writing. The guy is clearly a snake oil salesman and I don't intend to dabble in any more of his bullshit.\n\nI'm not expecting to get another dime out of this, but am curious if I have any legal standing to recoup. I imagine there's some sort of statute of limitations that may be in play?

We have lived here 3 years with no issues and have always paid rent on time. We did not sign a lease after the 2nd year so we have been technically living here month to month. \n\nIn February, I was texted from a random number (with no notification from rental company) that our home is for sale and access to our home was needed for a showing. I didn\u2019t respond because I was not informed our house on the market (although after looking, I found our house listed for sale on MLS). I didn\u2019t answer because I have no idea who this person is and i didn\u2019t even know our home was for sale.

We told him yes, but that we had a friend collect the key so he would have to pick up the spare from the rental company. This shouldn\u2019t have been an issue since he said he would go get the key from the rental company if we didn\u2019t answer before. \n\nWhen we got home today around 3:45pm, we found the spare key laying outside our door. We did not consent to a key being left out but just assumed it was an annoying accident and let it go. When we got inside, a curtain rod was broken and other small things were moved. We texted the realtor to ask about it and he did not respond. \n\nAn hour later, a neighbor let me know that someone just tried to walk into our home. I assumed it was an accident because we live in a cluster of 4 homes. Neighbor told me he saw the couple walk up to our door and reach up in the spot where the key we found was \u201chidden\u201d. The neighbor asked \u201ccan I help you?\u201d And the people stated that their realtor said we were out of town and they could go look at our house using the key that a realtor left outside our home. We never consented or were notified, and while  we sat on the couch after a long drive home, strangers tried to enter our home. We texted the realtor AGAIN and he told us he thought we wouldn\u2019t be home and that he scheduled \u201cseveral\u201d showings while we were gone without asking/informing us. \n\nWe told the realtor and he told us he will have the landlord give us our 30 days notice since our place is \u201cabout to sell\u201d and having us out would make it easier to sell.

Bonus. Notwithstanding the following, this Section only comes into effect if (a) Employee is still employed by Company; and (b) Employee has not otherwise breached this Agreement. Company shall pay Employee a designated percentage of all net proceeds collected by company on each customer invoice. The percentages to be paid are as follows: 1% of <redacted> Invoices; 1% of <redacted> Invoices; 1% of <redacted> Invoices; 1% of <redacted>; 1% of the <redacted>; 1% <redacted>. The amount collected shall not include any amount collected to pay sales tax or similar tax. No bonus is accrued unless and until the customer pays the invoice. Company shall pay the bonus monthly in arrears. This bonus is subject to withholding for federal income, social security, and any other applicable taxes.\n\nThen on 3/2/2020 I received a compensation reduction letter stating that due to the pandemic and economic crash, I would no longer be employed and will be returning to \u201ccontract level\u201d (which previously involved me being paid on a per-project basis) and that all commissions and bonuses are suspended until June 1,2020.\n\nShortly after, on or around March 16, 2020, I was asked to return to my salary position and immediately re-joined the team. But I did not, nor was I asked to, sign any new employment agreement. All I was asked to do was fill out a new W4 and that was it.\n\nOnce June 1, 2020 rolled around, no employee in the company heard anything about the bonuses returning.\n\nMy main questions are:\n\nIs my employment contract even valid considering I was let go, then rehired, without signing any new agreements?\n\nIf the contact IS valid, does the agreement even allow for a reduction/removal of my bonus based on the wording in the bonus section?\n\nIs it possible that I am owed for every month\u2019s bonus since March? Or if they were within their right to reduce pay, am I at least owned the bonuses since the aforementioned June 1st date?\n\nLocated in Texas\n\nThanks in advance for any input"}, {"id": "ibur36", "n_comments": 1, "name": "Custody of dog", "text": "Hi all.

I\u2019m seeking solidarity during these dark and difficult times of disparity and very little clarity ensuing from the prevalent COVID-19 pandemic pandemonium. It\u2019s hard to diverge from the discouraging urge to, but I refuse to accept defeat. I refuse to decline and go coward in my seat and have my virtue told to retreat. To have my decency and dignity devoured by those whom already hold too much power but provide little promise to empower. With that said, any and all advice/help is greatly appreciated and will only produce positivity to all else in similar situations. \n              So here we go. First to paint a fuller picture let me fill you in on some history to better explain how we\u2019ve arrived in quite the awkward mess we\u2019re currently sitting in. My roommate and I have been renting out an un-permitted ADU (accessory dwelling unit) since February 2018 up to present time. We originally set a verbal agreement for a month-to-month leasing option at $1k/month. As our tenancy continued we were approached and informed of price increases to either the rent or the amount of utilities we would be obligated to pay which at first began with utilities supposed to have already been included in the original $1k for rent to utilities being an  additional $50 aside from it. No big deal. So we happily forked over the change. By our first year anniversary we were up to paying $1100 for rent and $100 for utilities. This was annoying at most but not totally irrational, or unreasonable, so we brushed it off and forked over the cash. Between February 2019 and 2020 the rent had gone up to $1400 for initial rent plus an additional $200-250 for utilities. At this point it became clear it was probably well within our best interest to redirect our resources towards a more worthy residence. And then the pandemic happened, creating the uncanny conditions to birth this cosm of clusterfuk! What has followed is truly unprecedented and apparently the solution is as ambiguous. To my dismay as surreal this all certainly feels , this is my current reality. A new normal I didn\u2019t expect but not one I necessarily have to accept. My roommate has an underlying health condition which puts her at higher risk with the virus so she tries best to social distance herself. She was last hospitalized around the New Years holiday where she was admitted for a severe respiratory failure and intubated whilst under a medically induced coma for 3 days. The ADU we are renting does not have any running water so there is no bathroom, also it has no kitchen etc. We originally had access to those amenities located in the main house on the property. but due to a disagreement over use of such resulted in an assault from her co-worker(our land lady but not the owner of the house), we have been denied access as they went forth and changed the locks on the doors. She tried to serve us a self help constructive eviction but we requested a judicial unlawful detainer to be served. Us not being able to access the shower or wash our clothes, use the restroom etc. resulted in us paying for a hotel to be able to remain clean and take care of our personal health. While we were at the hotel over the weekend though we were tipped off by my roommates kids dad that she broke into our house and took pictures to try and humiliate/belittle my roommate by sending her kids father pictures of her inside our house saying it was messy and unlivable. We called the cops and told the the whole story and let them know we still live there and wanted to press charges. They advised they could do a civil standby for us to get our property but our lock had since been changed by the co-worker (lady who\u2019s lives in the main house but not the landlord of the property just who is renting as a passive income) who they arrested. And this is where we\u2019re confused. We are trying to go back home now that we have made our stand and would like a legal eviction process to protect our rights we are both out of work as result of the pandemic and have no choice but to stay in our place for the time being until we can save to move out ASAP. It seems like the cops think we have an alternative but that\u2019s not the case. So am I wrong for thinking we shouldn\u2019t face displacement/ homelessness if we haven\u2019t done anything wrong and should be allowed to resume our tenancy until the proper judicial process is complete?

Again, after telling her this, she backed down again and said she would return him back to me when I return from Japan. There is a large time gap as I had went about my study abroad experience thinking I would receive my cat upon my return. Surely enough I return only to find out she had moved to North Carolina and took my cat with her. She also went through the extra effort of replacing his collar, tags as well as registering my cat with the US Army, or at least that's what she told me.

I have screenshots to prove I was not at all threatening and just wished to have my cat back.
